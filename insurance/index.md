# Insurance

The federal reserve will back the insurance industry.

The federal government will deploy an application to the industry that will enable people to sell and service insurance to the market place.

We will develop best practices for claim management, fraud and the "nuances" of selling insurance.

We will provide market analysis of coverage by any location to find markets.
