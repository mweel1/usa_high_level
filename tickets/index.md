# Tickets

Licensed businesses would register to issue tickets with a licensed e-mail address for selling tickets.

They would all have their own queue to sell tickets.

An API would be provided that would allow tickets to be purchased in a first in first out queue and issued and go into the personal profile where they would be redeemed at the sellers licensed location.

The keys would have a probability of 1 to 100000000000000000.
