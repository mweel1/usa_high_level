# E-Visa

E-Visa would allow a user to go to the Visa site and create a personal profile much like the social security office provides them for citizens, however these would be controlled by the Visa office.

The same citizen personal provider services would be used.

Visa's can be revoked by removing the DNS system at the visa office where there use of the personal profile will be discontinued.
