# Federal/State/Local Emergency Dispatch

Today using a mobile phone there is no way to communicate via Text Message, or critical emergency actions.

The federal/local dispatch directory would provide services to allow the operating system to communicate with the various dispatch systems in the marketplace.

Any geo-location can be sent with a [command set](/command-set) which will automatically connect to their federal, state, or local dispatch services based on where the request came from.

A user of an operating system and AI Assistance would be able to provide the following services with their local dispatch systems:

- Initiate text message could
- Request immediate medical emergency
- Make a 911 call
  The operating system must provide the users govt id and location during the communication handshakes.
- Start a video conference

Due to the complexities of the market place and many services working with many various dispatch systems, the federal government will provide a dispatch system to the market place based on industry integrations.

The system must be replicated in a way where it can be used locally with complete redundancy, there will be no top surface.

There will be a single interface from the various services including operating systems, and AI Assistants that can is completely fault tolerant with multiple DNS entries for service that the client must work through based on closest API point.

An API will be available to download geo-fences and the API end point to use.

All jurisdictions must have a closed loop walkies talkie radio network for extra redundancy, a public radio frequency must be available for all citizens.
