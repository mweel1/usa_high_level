They may monitor calls, metadata (such as call duration, numbers dialed, and locations), and encrypted communications to detect threats related to terrorism, cybercrime, and foreign espionage. They also analyze patterns in phone usage to identify suspicious activity, track persons of interest, and support counterintelligence operations. While direct access to phone content often requires legal authorization, the NSA works with telecom providers and other agencies to collect and analyze large-scale communication data for security purposes.</p><p><a href="/national-security-agency.html">nsa.gov</a></p><h1 id="fcc-application-zones" tabindex="-1">FCC Application Zones <a class="header-anchor" href="#fcc-application-zones" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;FCC Application Zones&quot;">​</a></h1><p>This would setup a channel to receive application zone details when users were in certain areas and pressed the application zone option on their operating system.</p><p><a href="/domain-zones.html">FCC Application Zone</a>.</p><h1 id="children-device-protection" tabindex="-1">Children Device Protection <a class="header-anchor" href="#children-device-protection" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Children Device Protection&quot;">​</a></h1><p>Service keys to manage the use of devices for guardians.</p><p><a href="/children-electronic-device-protection-agency/">Children Device Protection</a></p><h1 id="fbi" tabindex="-1">FBI <a class="header-anchor" href="#fbi" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;FBI&quot;">​</a></h1><p>The FBI uses location data for criminal investigations, counterterrorism, and missing persons cases by tracking suspects, fugitives, or abducted individuals.

Agencies like the CDC and NIH track diseases and fund medical research, while the FDA monitors drug safety. CMS oversees Medicare and Medicaid, and the VA and DoD manage healthcare for veterans and military personnel. The FTC regulates consumer health data privacy, and DHS or NSA may analyze data for biosecurity threats. State and local health departments use data for disease control and healthcare improvements, while law enforcement may access it for fraud investigations.

Small business agencies (SBA, economic development offices) manage loans and grants, and business licensing bodies ensure regulatory compliance. Payroll and employment agencies (SSA, DOL) verify wages and benefits, while bankruptcy and debt collection entities (FTC, courts) address financial distress and legal claims.
