When an emergency operation is present, a geo-fence is placed around the zone and the applications are deployed to the citizens. For example a disaster response team could highlight a location during a fire and deploy zone applications. All phone companies must provide a satellite connectivity for these emergency zones over a slow-ip connection on handset companies so there can be communication to the operation centers.</p><p>The <a href="/ecs-gov/">emergency notification</a> system will be used to notify the emergency zone has been deployed and launch it the applications based on FEMA&#39;s application group types.</p><p>All applications will be developed by FEMA.</p><p>Emergency Zone application can mark applications as leave behind which will remain sticky until deleted by the user, for example if they evacuate to a hotel and need to file an insurance claim.</p><p>All operating systems must use the usa:// prefix when resolving DNS names for security purposes.</p><h5 id="direct-user-application-zones" tabindex="-1">Direct User Application Zones <a class="header-anchor" href="#direct-user-application-zones" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Direct User Application Zones&quot;">​</a></h5><p>Any manager of application zones can add specific profile URLs (or users) which would allow specific applications to launch when that user is specifically added to that zone. One example a specific waiter at a restaurant. There will be role capabilities with this also which will allow you to assign many users to a role also.</p><h3 id="internal-zones" tabindex="-1">Internal Zones <a class="header-anchor" href="#internal-zones" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Internal Zones&quot;">​</a></h3><p>It might feel natural to want internal zones of a business. However, its a risk if there are two many micro-zones, as people would be wondering around trying to find applications in public places.</p><p>In this case the recommended way to do this will be the use of numbers. A couple of example of this is:</p><ul><li>Press a button to pay for parking and then entering a lot #.</li><li>Press a button to pay for a meter, and entering a meter #.</li><li>Pressing a button in a hotel room and retrieving the hotel room via a personal profile receipt.</li></ul><p>At least to start, I could be proven otherwise once the technology is released but that my feeling to start for safety measures.</p><h2 id="network-zone" tabindex="-1">Network Zone <a class="header-anchor" href="#network-zone" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Network Zone&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Network zones allow applications to be launched based on SSID of the network.</p><p>Toyota setups a new SSID in a car and network.</p><p>Registers it with the FCC, and assigns it to an application group that they manage.</p><p>When the operating system receives the SSID prefixed by NZ: it will request the application by the FCC.</p><p>Operating system triggers can also be sent via SSID handshakes for example:</p><ul><li>Restrict age appropriate content (i.e. don&#39;t allow people to play illicit content on an airplane)</li></ul><h2 id="department-of-transportation" tabindex="-1">Department of Transportation <a class="header-anchor" href="#department-of-transportation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Department of Transportation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Anyone with a transportation authority can upload proof of their authority, along with their street zone.</p><p>With the street zone they can:</p><ul><li>Set the speed of vehicles</li><li>Create warning messages</li><li>No Drive Zone</li></ul><h2 id="mobile-handset-domain-zone-triggers" tabindex="-1">Mobile Handset Domain Zone Triggers <a class="header-anchor" href="#mobile-handset-domain-zone-triggers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Mobile Handset Domain Zone Triggers&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Application Zones can trigger control commands in operating systems at certain times that might:</p><ol><li>Turn off the ability to use a camera (for example at a concert)</li><li>Turn off a ring sound (for example in a movie theater), and switch all phones to vibrate.</li><li>Restrict age appropriate content</li></ol><h2 id="why-fcc" tabindex="-1">Why FCC? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-fcc" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why FCC?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Its important this is an FCC asset due to the fact if operating systems tried to deliver this type of solution to the users there would many different &quot;domain zones&quot; for citizens which would make it very confusing for users. It&#39;s important users get a consistent experience no matter what operating system they are on from vehicle operating systems, to mobile handsets.</p><h2 id="risks" tabindex="-1">Risks <a class="header-anchor" href="#risks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Risks&quot;">​</a></h2><p>One of the big risks with this technology is that people will be wondering around always pressing a button to see what application service is available. The <a href="/public-service-announcements/">public service announcement system</a> will broadcast the best way to use these applications easily and safely. Each Application Zone will have a limit of 15 applications.</p><h2 id="project-plan" tabindex="-1">Project Plan <a class="header-anchor" href="#project-plan" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Project Plan&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Our first version of the application will be done deployed federally at national parks in partnership with Intel&#39;s new phone.</p>',55)]))}const m=a(o,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
