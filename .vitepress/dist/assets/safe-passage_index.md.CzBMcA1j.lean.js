Inmates get released and must find transitional housing on their own. This gap in service creates friction as the inmate doesn’t have resources when leaving jail and very quickly turn to crime and end back up into jail, or not find housing at all and live on the streets.</p><p>The Safe Passage software platform’s goal is to provide an integrated collaborative platform between the jails, transitional housing facilities and inmates to provide the jail’s consolers the ability to apply for housing on an inmate’s behalf, reserve beds, and have safe transport to transitional housing facilities.</p><p>Safe Passage also allows inmates to be placed by crime, allowing transitional housing services the ability to provide services in different locations based on criminal backgrounds. This will help improve finding facilities in a wide range of locals.</p><h2 id="stakeholders" tabindex="-1">Stakeholders <a class="header-anchor" href="#stakeholders" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Stakeholders&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The following stakeholders would participate in this platform.</p><h3 id="orange-county-social-services" tabindex="-1">Orange County Social Services <a class="header-anchor" href="#orange-county-social-services" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Orange County Social Services&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Orange County Social Services would be given the platform under their direction and discretion.
