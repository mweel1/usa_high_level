We will have the capability to press a button on your phone, turn off your kids device and have them do chores or something.</p><p><strong>Domain Zones:</strong> Replace the QR Code code that you scan in places with a simple press of a button where multiple applications will come up based on your location. This technology will bring billions, if not trillions in market place value when combined with local B2B networks.</p><p><strong>Digital Rights Protection:</strong> Reinvent copyright systems to give individuals control over their digital works.</p><p><strong>Surveillance Transparency:</strong> Establish clear constitutional guidelines for government and tech industry surveillance, and provide the security through the personal profile to allow it in an open forum.</p><p><strong>Grant Management System:</strong> Implement a platform to manage grants across all government levels, addressing issues like homelessness.
