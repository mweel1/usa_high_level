# Realestate

People would navigate to a map, or press the domain zone button.

They would select realtors, a list of .realtors would come up sorted by default by the most popular, based on DNS logs. The city could do whatever they wanted here for the directory and its ordering.

They would all have social applications, this could be:

1. Tours
2. Tik Tok Type Navigation
3. Magazines

They would have a button that would allow people to schedule a showing, or apply.

If apply was selected, a list of .banks in town could be listed with interest rates and terms would be selected based on your credit score. You could then apply, and the bank would contact you with further instructions via e-mail.

The realtor applications, would connect to .homes-for-sale the media would be uploaded with defined tags and the realtors would have to integrate accordingly.

I could see aggregator services in the market to make it easier for the realtors, or they could do the heavy lifting themselves.

The media would be available based on a last updated date, where it could be queried with a URL.
