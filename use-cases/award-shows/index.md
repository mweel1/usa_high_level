# Award Shows

Local bank would approve to purchase a theater.

The theater would rent out space for various events.

I would create an award show network and ask people to share their music collection with me.

I would then provide a vote by the audience to select the winners.

We would then have a show at the theater where the bands can accept the awards and say a little something.
