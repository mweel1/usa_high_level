# Government Agencies

Since we are going to be depending on the suffix for the business type on the American Internet, that raises issue for government agencies as they will also be use suffixes. For example, .police-department.

It's important the operating system identify these organizations, along with authorization and authentication mechanisms.

I'd propose we provide a certificate for all government agencies from the home land security licensing agency when setting up domains.

When browsing to these websites, they would check their /certificate API end-point for the license, and then check the license at homeland security and then provide the proper watermarks in browsers, and e-mail clients.

Yes, Government agency sites will be a little slower on initial loading, and I am fine with that.
