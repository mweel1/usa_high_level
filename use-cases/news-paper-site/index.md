# News Paper / Site

You would have a licensed docker container that would provide a news site.

You could have news based on:

1. Other news sites
2. Press Releases from Personal Profile
3. Press Releases from Businesses

In the case of news sites, a link must be provided to another .news site where licensed press holders are.

In the case of press releases from personal profiles, during the licensing process of the operating system it's reviewed how the quotation system is working between personal profiles, and businesses.
