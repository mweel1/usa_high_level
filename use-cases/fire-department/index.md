# Fire Department Use Cases

## Dispatch to Fires

Typically fire departments are called for fires from their local dispatch.

Citizens will now have the ability to send a notification to the local dispatch that there is a fire with there exact location.

Furthermore, using [satellite sensors that captures heat signals](/grants/heat-map-sat/) a fire department can be notified.

## Public Education

Using the [public service announcement system](/public-service-announcements/) can educate communities about fire safety, evacuation plans, and prevention measures.

## Street Lights and Vehicle Notifications

Using short range wireless communication when an emergency vehicle is driving down the street, all vehicles with a [operating system](/vehicle-technology-act/) would be provided a notification to be on an alert for emergency vehicles where the radio would be turned down.
