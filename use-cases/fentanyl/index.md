# Fentanyl

We will reduce fentanyl deaths by legalizing drugs and using [transaction safety at the point of sale](/transaction-safety/) to ensure they are used in a safe and effective manner.

Suppliers that provide bad products will be prosecuted in the jury system.

Social Services will be integrated into the Personal Profile to look at drug use and personal finances to see if people are moving to a risky situation.
