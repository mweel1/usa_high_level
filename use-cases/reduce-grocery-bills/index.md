# Reduce Grocery Bills

Grocery companies profits have been in steep decline to help reduce inflation. However that has not fixed it. As the world population grows we are all after for the same products.

- Reduce grocery bills by providing more manufacturing, distribution and retail of the food supply chain here at home to enable competitive pricing.

- Using the [micro-industrial revolution](/grants/micro-industrial-revolution/) the goal would be to reduce transportation costs and the cost of goods.

- In rural areas I would also setup API based networks to buy and sell homegrown food with the community.

- Suggest recommend limiting the amount of food that is consumed by the population. If we all just reduced our intake by 25% that could reduce grocery prices by 25%.

- B2B API's would improve efficiency and reduce costs for small businesses.
