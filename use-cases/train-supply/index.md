# Train Supply

Department of Transportation would provide train districts for trains to ship goods between.

In these districts, the train transportation would allow you to buy flat bed cargo space on the rail system for a price by bidding it out for space. The price would be from one port to another.

All cargo containers would be part of the district and shippers and receivers would receive a credit and debit for the cargo when they take them off the rails, or put them on. Cargo carts will be available in cargo lots around ports with a open system to temporarily purchase.

All cargo will be matched up with shippers if cargo containers do not make them back to the yard where their license will be revoked.

This would be done by adding a new line to the track.

The first district would be from Leucadia to Mexico and Back.

Current main suppliers of the area like Amazon, Food companies and other will provide a back channel to Mexico. There is a lot inland we could bring east.

You would have to:

- Loan for acquisition of AmTrack and cargo equipment
- Create the switch lines between passenger and new cargo rails.
- Attach GPS to all rails vehicles, and put a secure API on all switches and run a control system on a schedule.
