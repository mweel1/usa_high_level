# Mis-Information

Mis-information is a large problems on todays Internet.

The [USA Internet](/USA-Internet/) will have a robust [licensing system](/USA-Internet/personal-licensing-agency/) for anyone with a large audience where they must operate under a code of conduct or their license will be revoked and they will loose access to social media sites.

If social media sites do not enforce press licenses and their requirements their domain can be revoked, and/or fined.

Mis-information will be further curtailed by filtering content through a moderation service to ensure no information is released on a mass scale that would be a determent to national security or safety.

All social media sites owner must also be licensed.

Information provided from 3rd party sources must provide a source.
