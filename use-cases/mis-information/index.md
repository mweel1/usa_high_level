The [USA Internet](/USA-Internet/) will have a robust [licensing system](/USA-Internet/personal-licensing-agency/) for anyone with a large audience where they must operate under a code of conduct or their license will be revoked and they will loose access to social media sites.

If social media sites do not enforce press licenses and their requirements their domain can be revoked, and/or fined.

National Security will be curtailed by filtering content through a moderation service to ensure no information is released on a mass scale that would be a risk to national security.

All social media sites owner must also have a licensed domain.
