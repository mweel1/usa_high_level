# Incident Response Teams

Whenever there is a fire or other national emergency impacting many people. An incident response command and control can deploy a set of [applications to an affected zone](/USA-Internet/domain-zone/) where the user can press a button or select an app on any device and receive the applications that are deployed to manage the emergency situation all the way through.

They can also use the [emergency notification system](/ecs-gov/) to keep citizens notified during a crisis across all devices.
