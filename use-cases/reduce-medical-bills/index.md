# Reduce Medical Bills

## On-call doctors on a cash basis

One of the major concerns today is health costs, remote doctors would provide services on-line or in person for cash.

We will provide a .remote-doctor that would allow them to provide doctors services on-line or at your house or place of work.

They would need to go through the educational processes in-order to receive this license.

Once the license is received they could log-in to various sites and provide their services to the market place.

A B2B API would be available for all their scheduling and payments.

These Doctors would not be able to take insurance.

## Testing

I would also invest heavily in all the various testing metrologies to provide services and get that to a cash system also.
