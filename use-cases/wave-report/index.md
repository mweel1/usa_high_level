# Wave Reports

NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S.) will setup domain zones for the surf where an API will be provided of surf size, currents, temperature, wind conditions, tide levels, and other oceanographic data.

This API will allow developers and researchers to access real-time and historical surf conditions, enabling applications for weather forecasting, marine safety, surfing reports, and coastal management. The system will utilize data from NOAA’s network of ocean buoys, satellites, and coastal monitoring stations to provide accurate and up-to-date information.

Additionally, the API will support integrations with third-party applications, allowing surf forecasting websites, mobile apps, and scientific research institutions to leverage NOAA’s data for enhanced insights into ocean conditions.

This will be integrated with city applications for the function, for example:
