# Credit

Applying for credit when purchasing products will be easy.

Domains with .credit must be registered.

All .credit domains will provide the following on their API:

## Pricing

Each credit company will have to provide an API that will show the price per $100.00 along with a credit score that will be standardized based on the customers ledger. This will allow customers to shop for credit in the market place.

## Application

The person applying for a credit card will provide the following when applying for credit:

- Their ledger balance across all their banks.
- The amount they would like to receive in credit.

## Surcharge

The government can place a surcharge on debt if debt becomes to high.

## Approval

Once approved, an oAuth link will be sent to the personal profile where the customer will click the link and authorize the bank to receive money from the credit card company. Once the oAuth process is completed:

- The money will be sent to the customer bank.
- Bills will be placed in the personal profile for the payments due.
