# Subscription Service Approach

Many people I tell about these ideas believe in subscription services.

This is how a subscription service would.

1. Artists would sell music under a subscription service license and require a % of their % used.
2. There would be an open source subscription service platform available for artists and consumers -- its a commodity at this point.
3. Not to say other subscription services could be deployed.
4. The user would go to the subscription service, sign-up, get a key, and use the music just like today.
5. All media must have a unique-id so it can be transported in links.

I'm at a bar and I have a playlisted artist I want to play on the juke box...

I would go to the jukebox app, enter the music id and buy it from wherever the jukebox company did.
