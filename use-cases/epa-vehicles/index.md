# Environmental Protection Agency

Could provide a platform that would allow people to vote, and provide enforcement policies.

All enforcement policies must be supported on the American Internet in a b2b network.

Anything deemed to impactful must be done in a city context.

The EPA could provide funding as part of dealing with that.

For example, the EPA could make a case for vehicles to leave communities and have transportation in and out via rental vehicles.

A local taxi fleet that is 75% less weight could be deployed in the inner cities.

The EPA could offer the average car payment a month in the area to do it.

External Parking & Rental Facilities for vehicles would be available for long haul.

All vehicles would have to have complete safety systems for cities.

No transportation plans must impede with external traffic factors.
