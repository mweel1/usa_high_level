# Hotel Marketing

I would give my personal profile to a hotel to let me know when they have last minute deals.

They would send me an offer to my personal profile with the information, and I would purchase the reservation.

So each Hotel would have an interested in offers services.

# Bot

I would have a bot that would look at our inventory for the following day.

I'd send out a request at 20% of normal hotel reservation.

Wait two hours for 1/3 of the people and send out another one at 40% not including anyone who signed up.

Wait another two hours for last 1/3 of the people and send out another one at 70% not including anyone who signed up.

The percentage deduction I would change based on the results I was getting from the previous requests
