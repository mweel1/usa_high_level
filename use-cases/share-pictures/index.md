# Pictures

First, I would have a pictures folder in my file system. I would use a specific file system and can switch for better pricing at any time.

Second, I would share my picture folder with Shannon as read-only just like a drive back in the days, but over the Internet.

The operating system could have many applications attached to a picture folder either locally, or shared.
