# Mountain Bike Park

National Parks would provide grant money to the city for the park.

You would have a .adventure-park domain name.

You would have an API service layer for :

/buy-pass
/park-hours
/licenses

You would have domain zone apps for:

- Trail Maps
- Call for medical help
- Call for bike issues
- Meetups
- Message staff
- Licenses

    - Staff
    - Government License from National Park
    - Software

You would give free passes to residents.

You would sell passes.

You would be required to service it.

You would be required to have staff to help people.

When purchasing a pass, it would ask for your location while your at the park.

Some sort of gates would be required to check passes.

You would scan your phone where a personal profile would be provided.

The gate would ask the personal profile for a pass based on the domain name defined in the personal profile's pass.

If the biker did not have a phone, they would have to enter the personal profile into the device, and enter a pass code.

The device would send the pass-code with a request for the pass.  This end point request/relationship with the gate system and the personal profile would be licensed.
