# AI Assistant

Each personal profile will be bound to many AI Voice Assistance's where you will be provide a name.

Each AI Assistant will ask for permissions to your personal profile based on the permissions it needs to provide services with a name. For example:

I would bind my AI Assistant to my standards based home automation hub(s).
I would bind my AI Assistance to licensed map services (which might include Google, Warez and others)

# Home Automation

With that you would say "Hi Honey", using my home automation service please turn off all the lights in the house.

# Directions

or "Hi Honey", give me directions to In & Out, where the AI Device would return a command to the operating system to show a map.

# Parking

"Hi Honey", please pay for parking. Where the AI device would call the parking business API for the parking structure to buy a parking ticket with the selected e-check or card.

# Emergency Services

- All AI voice assistance would have to authenticate with federal emergency dispatch services.
