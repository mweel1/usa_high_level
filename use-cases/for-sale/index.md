# For Sale

Selling personal items is a big part of commerce.

On the American Internet this would be the process.

# Listing

You would have a for-sale personal profile section that the operating system would allow you to add items to.

You would then press your domain zone button.

You would find the for-sale applications, there would be an option to share your for-sale items where they would be posted.

The price on the network would be defaulted to your personal profile, but can be changed or each application, including set it for bidding.

# Selling

Once someone found your product, it would be paid for, and optionally licensed shippers could deliver the product.

The order would be received in the section of your for-sale personal profile, with shipping details and payment details, where the product could be removed from the for-sale items at your discretion.

The receipt would be placed in the buyers personal profile.
