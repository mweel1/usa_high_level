# Video Networks

Video networks will still be available in the market place and various domain zones.

These will operate by purchasing content from content providers via one-time transaction or based on subscription %'s. The media will be transferred from one media server to another attached between the two businesses where it will be checked for copyrite violations.

The content filtering would have taken place on the original upload of the media to their media server.
