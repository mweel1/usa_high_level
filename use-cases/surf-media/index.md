# Surf Media Platform

# Content Providers/Ads

The content providers would host their content on a .content-provider domain for sale selecting business attribute tags as "surf", and a .advertiser for "surf". They would host it on a domain zone and can be found in local markets.

# Network

The network would purchase content and ads for public distribution.

# Domain Zone / Searching

The network would create a domain zone to sell the content to local facilities at the city level, under .content-network where you could via a directory or map find the domain with the tags.

# Purchasing

You would boot your OS, and search the network by directory or map, and purchase the content for $x public use.

# Viewing

You would receive a URL in your business content store with a URL with a key. Media control systems could use these URL's for all kinds of control technologies.
