# Child Care

We will deploy a trade schools for child care licenses where child care professionals can get a child care license.

They can receive loans to start .child-care domain names and must adhere to the specification.

The deployment of capital of trade schools will be based on the demand of child care through e-census queries.

Then eventually, The treasury we will have an education account code in our personal profile ledgers and we can see the transactions that way to see if education costs are to high in areas based on income.
