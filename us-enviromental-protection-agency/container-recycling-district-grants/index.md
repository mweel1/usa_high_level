## Container Recycling

Recycle Districts can be setup for any type of reusable container where grants can be provided for storage depots, and shared with any trading partner.

Containers could include:

- Packaging Containers
- Kegs for drinks
- Rail Road Containers
- Truck Cargo Containers

There are many use cases for recycling containers, from packaging to kegs for drinks.

When receiving a bill of lading, a container would be marked on to your account with the business.

When returning a container to a 3rd party or the storage depot, the container would be removed from your business.

These would be setup by business partners that shared in the value chain.
