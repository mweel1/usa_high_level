# Sustainable Transportation Grants

For cities that would like to remove cars from the roads can apply for city grants to bring up autonomous vehicle networks. Which would including busing and vehicles.

Grants would be provided for autonomous & regular vehicles in leu of personal vehicles. All grants provided must have a voting and complaint system to ensure vehicles are clean, and drivers are licensed, and quality of service is measured.

We should work on average for a 5 minute pick up time.

If anything longer than that is recorder over a period of time of two weeks, more vehicles must be purchased by the grant money.

Furthermore, rental lots outside of these zones would be funded to rent vehicles.

Police would set rules on what vehicles are allowed in for construction, maint. etc.

After a skathing report on ?? years of fossil fuel at our current rate, bus systems, walking towns, trains will make a huge comeback via the grants.
