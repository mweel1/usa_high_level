You would log-in to a device, and enter a personal-profile URL or create a new one.

## New Personal Profile

For new personal profiles, you would goto the social security website:

- Select a server provider.
- Select a media server provider.

The social security personal provider would be provisioned and returned a JWT and Refresh Token where the operating system could log-in via the oAuth process. The personal profile will be secured by e-mail and password.

The following would be required to setup the personal profile:

- Upload and verify identification
- Upload and verify credit cards
