# Transactions

## Card Present

You would touch a blue tooth pad that would have a callback URL that would accept a transactional card id from the operating system, that card id would be transacted on the network long with the personal profile where the receipt would be placed.

## Card Not Present

You would goto a website, via javascript it would show a card list. You would select the card, get the card transaction id, and pass it back through the javascript function where the card id would be submitted to the server and processed.
