# Operating System Login

When starting an Apple or Microsoft computer for the first time, it will have them setup a personal profile with the social security on the American Internet.

This will be done, by the operating system receiving a list of providers from th USA internet by reviewing the directory of .personal-profile-providers.

They will redirect to these providers, and create a profile.

As part of creating the profile the user must :

- Enter their full name and address.

# State Issued ID

When uploading their state issued ID it's oAuthed with the department of motor vehicles for verification, to make a connection to the department of motor vehicles where its verified.

The state issued ID can be presented by the operating system with a government designed seal and bar code.

# Social Security

Once their profile is created, it's oAuth'ed with the Social Security Office.

If the state ID is already in the system, it redirected to a recovery process for the profile.

The Social Security than asks for permission to receive their full name and address to receive social security checks.

Once approved, the user is logged in to their session under that personal profile Id.

# Visa and Mastercard

Second, and optionally the user can oAuth to Visa & Mastercard and import all their credit cards and setup the connection for transactional card Ids.

# API

The only API available for the version will be to the handset carriers to make sure systems are operating correctly. The API surface will include:

/identification/state/<id>
/payment-cards
/payment-cards (add)
/payment-cards (update)

# Operating System Startup

The operating systems will startup exactly the way they do today. At some point, a new browser will be added to the operating system for the American Internet where users can switch between the two.
