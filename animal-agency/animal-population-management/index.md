## License Breeders

License breeders would be allowed to login to the animal agency where they would request to breed animals.

## Request to breed

Based on inventory of the breed and sales trends in the area the breeder would get an approval for breeding.

Depending on the technology available DNA could be sampled by the parents where any issues of breeding could be brought up and denied.

## Sales

A commission between the breeder and the sales channel would be setup.

Licensed sales channels on the [/american-internet](/american-internet/) would be allowed to view upcoming inventory and sell it to customers who would have to go through a licensing process to own the animal.
