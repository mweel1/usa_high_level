# Transaction Safety

Transactions for at risk products and service would be checked at all point of sales and declined for red-flags. Red flags including but not limited to prescriptions, gambling, bomb making material, bulk purchases of gas or other energy sources.

# Legalization of illicit drugs

The illegal drug trade has a lot of issues including corruption, poisoning, education, and substance abuse.

The transaction safety system would ensure that controls are places on illicit drugs the same way pharmaceuticals are managed. Controls would be put in place to ensure people do abuse these drugs base on guidelines.

# Pharmaceutical Safety

The pharmaceutical safety services would require POS systems at pharmacies to send UPC information and a government Id and would check for drug abuse by doctor prescriptions.

# Gambling

Many people have lost their life savings to gambling. These transaction rails would ensure if someone was isn't in the position to be gambling safely they wouldn't be able to.
