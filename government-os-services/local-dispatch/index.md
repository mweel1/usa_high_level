# Citizen to Local Dispatch Communication

## Overview

Today using a mobile phone there is no way to communicate via Text Message, or critical emergency actions.

The Citizen to local dispatch directory would provide services to allow the operating system to communicate with local dispatch systems.

A directory of dispatch systems along with the standards in which each local dispatch must implement would be available to the operating system.

This would give a citizen in a certain geo-location the ability to automatically connect to their local dispatch providers.

A user of an operating system would be able to provide the following services with their local dispatch systems:

- Initiate text message could 
- Request immediate medical emergency
- Make a 911 call 
The operating system must provide the users govt id and location during the communication handshakes.
