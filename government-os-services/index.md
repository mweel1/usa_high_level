# Preface

The government operating services would be a set of services that would have to be authenticated when a user installs their operating system. Once these services are authenticated they would provide keys to use the services at various interaction points in the operating system.

Operating system would include mobile phones, personal computers, vehicle systems, and any future devices users might work with.

Having a government operating system inside all operating system devices puts the government in control of communication, procedures and laws instead of continuing depend on companies like Apple and Google to provide these. This is problematic for a number reasons:

- The government having to work with many operating systems to deal with their technologies and policies for enforcement. How many do you want to work in this scenario? Your can only manage a few at best.
- Rules although might be clearly defined, are hard to enforce and monitor with operating system providers in the market.
- There is large infrastructure and resource costs for operating system providers to implement these requirements. Especially for new market participants.

# Overview

When a user uses their mobile, gaming or desktop operating system for the first time they will be required first to authenticate with [id.gov](./id-gov).

Once their government ID has been saved into the operating system they would need to authorize the following services:

- E-Check [echeck.gov](/e-check/)
- FCC Emergency Communication System [ecs.gov](/ecs-gov)
- National Security Agency [nsa.gov](/national-security-agency)
- FEMA Emergency Response Keys [fema.gov](/fema/)
- [Citizen to Local Dispatch Communication](/local-dispatch/)
- [Census Participation](/e-census/)
- [Jury Service](/jury-service/)

For vehicle OS's the following services would have to be authorized:

[Federal Roadway Signs](/federal-roadway-signs).

Operating Systems with shared datastores may use these authorizations (for example ICloud, etc)
