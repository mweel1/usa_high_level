# Preface

The government operating services would be a set of services that would have to be authenticated when a user installs their operating system. Once these services are authenticated they would provide keys to use the services at various interaction points in the operating system.

Operating system would include mobile phones, personal computers, vehicle systems, and any future devices users might work with.

Having a government operating system inside all operating system devices puts the government in control of communication, procedures and laws instead of continuing depend on companies like Apple and Google to provide these. This is problematic for a number reasons:

- The government having to work with many operating systems to deal with their technologies and policies for enforcement. How many do you want to work in this scenario? Your can only manage a few at best.
- Rules although might be clearly defined, are hard to enforce and monitor with operating system providers in the market.
- There is large infrastructure and resource costs for operating system providers to implement these requirements. Especially for new market participants.

# Overview

When a user uses their mobile, gaming or desktop operating system for the first time they will be required first to authenticate with [id.gov](./id-gov).

Once their government ID has been saved into the operating system they would need to authorize the following services if they had not already.

- E-Check [echeck.gov](/e-check/)

- FCC Emergency Communication System [ecs.gov](/ecs-gov). To receive emergency communications from government agencies.

- National Security Agency [nsa.gov](/national-security-agency). To allow the government to access your phone with a warrant.

- FEMA Emergency Response Keys [fema.gov](/fema/)
  To allow the government to update keys on your phone to access emergency services.

- [Citizen to Local Dispatch Communication](/local-dispatch/). Allow the citizens to send dispatch requests to local dispatch for police and emergency services.

- [Census Participation](/e-census/). To register for census services via e-mail.

- [Jury Service](/jury-service/). This would register for jury services, where the operating system would provide notifications and reminders of needed jury service needs.

- [FBI](./fbi). This would allow the FBI to use your location if you were near an active investigation and would be need to be contacted for questioning.

Operating Systems with shared datastores may use these authorizations (for example ICloud, etc)

For vehicle OS's the following services would have to be authorized:

[Federal Roadway Signs](/federal-roadway-signs).

- FCC Emergency Communication System [ecs.gov](/ecs-gov). To receive emergency communications from government agencies.
