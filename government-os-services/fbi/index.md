# FBI

The FBI would aggregate criminal records and have access to the [citizen tracking datawarehouse](/citzen-data-warehouse/).

Jurisdictions could query the FBI services for example a police department could request the cell phone individuals that were in an area where a women was mugged.

The results would return not only the individuals in that area but also the criminal records associated with them.

Geo-fencing could also be setup for example a restraining order of two individuals could be setup where if one person came in with a certain area of another it would alert the person with the restraining order, where they could call the police via their [government os](/government-os-services/).
