# Water Temperature Agency

Water temp agencies will be responsible for managing UL certified devices to swim out in the water three times a day and take water temperatures where they will be logged into domain zone servers as laguna-beach-cress.water-temperature-readings. An public API surface will be available.

All water temperature reading domains must replicate their data to us-coast-guard where they will be available by location for consumer use and analysis.
