# Drug Legalization

CVS would provide a warehouse at the skirts of Silverado.

We would work with CVS as supplier, and integrate a pharmacy retail platform.

The retail platform would work with any drug supplier that met the requirements of the API and licensing (including illegal drugs).

See [Transaction Safety](/transaction-saftey/) to ensure safe drugs usage.
