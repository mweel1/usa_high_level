## FEMA Disaster Response System

The disaster response system would be a set of hardware and software services that would be deployed during devastating events where communication is not available through normal means.

The user would agree that FEMA would issue keys to enable their phone to access and emergency FEMA network.

## Network

A network of vehicles would be deployed with towers that would be constructed around the affected areas. This network would provide standard wi-fi services to users devices.

## Emergency Handshaking

Each night a list of keys would provided to [Government OS Services](/government-os-services/). These keys would be broadcasted in emergencies by the FEMA network.

When an OS receives these emergency SSID keys a URL is provided via the network handshake. This home page would include an application that would help with all disaster efforts.
