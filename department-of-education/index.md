# Federal Department of Education

The department of education grant system will provide technology and grant funding to states, and then ultimately districts to help manage their school districts via the federal department of education.

## Starting a School

Starting a school requires the proper licensing, finding enrolment, and registering a domain based on your grade level.

### Licensing

A person is [licensed](./teacher-license-requirements/) to become a teacher, where their certificate is placed in their personal profile.

A list of educational opportunities are provided for teachers to become licensed at the department of education which include colleges, and trade schools and will have their own set of requirements when applying to become a teacher.

### Domain Registration

#### Schools

Once licensed with their certificate they will apply to register .K6-school or .HS-school with their certificate subject credentials.

#### Districts

A .district domain will have all the services for the district that work with the schools, and the state.

Districts are created at the state level where the district must have:

- Schools that fill all subject matter required by the state
- Enrollment for the next year
- All teacher salaries are 30% greater than the median income.

## Organizing Teachers and Students

The state will provide a portal for new districts that will connect the community, this will include teachers, and parents. We will start with a few districts in a city. We will also publish areas where schools have a deficit and provide grants to teach teachers.

The state will set the the amount of hours each district's students have to participate in each subject each semester.

Furthermore, once children enrolled classes the DOE platform will ensure that all students are receiving their credit in the required subjects.

## Reporting

All [personal profiles](/grants/personal-profile) will have to oAuth with the department of education to predict school trends based on households in various areas.

Education tracking system will ensure it receives all the data about students and the needs for students for 2 years ahead and align teacher training programs with the children demand. All schools will have a buffer to ensure all children have the capability to attend school for new students. This will start with a 20% buffer.

The DOE application will provide the following application functionality:

- Apply for enrolment at schools
- Allow .school organizations to upload their coarse material for the students
- Set grades
- Scheduling module

Enrollment will ensure all vaccines have been completed where the doctors medical events will be in the personal profile of the student.

## School Training

The department of education will have training programs available for teachers on-line to train them on all .K8-education and .HS-education type's. We will have all types of schools from in classroom to field classes.

## School Location Objective

The objective of having many schools with grants is to have enough school facilities in walking distance from urban housing areas. Grants will include the ability to purchase many houses in neighborhoods and turn them into schools, along with having access to sport facilities.

Reporting and maps will be available to evaluate this for each district's.

Houses will be acquired by making offer on properties to willing sellers at 20-30% of value. These will be acquired and owned by the department of education at the state level.

## Field Trip Transportation

Transportation will be available for field trips, and sporting events with other high schools. There will be grants to provide transportation services on behalf of each district at the state level by the federal grant system.

## School Lunch

Lunch will be provided by the school by bidding out delivery of food services from the market place each week. The funding for lunches will be derived from grant money and will be part of the budget the district submits to the state. Local businesses will be responsible for delivering it based on schedules where children meet for lunch.

The school's will have an approved list of of food types that can be purchased under the school lunch program.

# Use Case

I'm a teacher who is going to teach computer class.

I get a certification to teach computer class based on my background by taking a test at the state by a licensed certification company.

The licensed certification company has a client id to put certificates into my personal profile.

I goto the states website and create marty-computer-class.K8-school class and attach it to a domain zone so people can find it. It can be federal, or local.

I then goto the state and ask for money for supplies with my enrolment, they are able to look at my enrolment in that area based on the data in the system and provide the grant.
