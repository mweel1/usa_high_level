They can optionally apply for grant money if its needed from the state, which must include your enrolment. Your enrollment can be from anywhere.

## Organizing Teachers and Students

The state will provide a portal for new districts that will connect the community, this will include teachers, and parents. We will start with a few districts in a city.

## Education Tracking

The state will set the the amount of hours each district's students have to participate in each subject.

The education tracking module will provide states the ability to track what subjects are missing for various districts so those can be provided to the market place and trained.

Furthermore, once children enrolled classes the DOE platform will ensure that all students are receiving their credit in the required subjects. All [personal profiles](/grants/personal-profile) will have to oAuth with the department of education to predict school trends based on households in various areas.

Education tracking system will ensure it receives all the data about students and the needs for students for 2 years ahead and align teacher training programs with the children demand. All schools will have a buffer to ensure all children have the capability to attend school for new students.

The DOE application will provide an API for each district and application that will allow students to:

- Apply for enrolment at schools
- Allow .school organizations to upload their coarse material for the students
- Set grades for various schools
- Scheduling module

All education statistics will be sent to the department of education at all levels above, and then the personal profile.

Enrollment will ensure all vaccines have been completed where the doctors medical events will be in the personal profile of the student.

## School Training

The department of education will have training programs available for teachers on-line to train them on all .K8-education and .HS-education type's.

## School Location Objective

The objective of having many schools with grants is to have enough school facilities in walking distance from urban housing areas. Grants will include the ability to purchase many houses in neighborhoods and turn them into schools, along with having access to sport facilities.

Reporting and maps will be available to evaluate this for each district's.

Houses will be acquired by making offer on properties to willing sellers.

## Field Trip Transportation

Transportation will be available for field trips, and sporting events with other high schools. There will be grants to provide transportation services on behalf of each district at the state level by the federal grant system.

## User Interfaces

Grades will be provided to the personal profile in an JSON format, or provided in open document format to viewed.

DOE will provide websites to students for course material given by the various licensed schools.

## School Lunch

Lunch will be provided by the school by bidding out delivery of food services from the market place each week. The funding for lunches will be derived from grant money and will be part of the budget the district submits to the state. Local businesses will be responsible for delivering it based on schedules where children meet for lunch.

The school's will have an approved list of of food types that can be purchased under the school lunch program.

# Use Case

I'm a teacher who is going to teach computer class.

I get a certification to teach computer class based on my background by taking a test at the state by a licensed certification company.

The licensed certification company has a client id to put certificates into my personal profile.

I goto the states website and create marty-computer-class.K8-school class and attach it to a domain zone so people can find it. It can be federal, or local.

I then goto the state and ask for money for supplies with my enrolment, they are able to look at the market in my area and see that there are those subjects lacking in that area based on the data in the system and provide the grant.

The kids are enrolled, and their personal profile is checked during enrolment.
