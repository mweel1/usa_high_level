Teachers will know what markets to find where teaching deficiencies are occurring, based on parent to child ratios.

### Domain Registration

All [personal profiles](/grants/personal-profile) will have to oAuth with the department of education to predict school trends based on the ages of households in various areas to better prepare.

Education tracking system will ensure it receives all the data about students and the needs for students for 2 years ahead and align teacher training programs with the children demand. All schools will have a buffer to ensure all children have the capability to attend school for new students. This will start with a 20% buffer.

Enrollment will ensure all vaccines have been completed where the doctors medical events will be in the personal profile of the student, or uploaded.

## School Training

The DOE will have training directories available for teachers to receive their license. The DOE will have all types of schools available to learn. Learning can be on-line services, trade schools, or colleges.

## School Location Objective

The objective of having many schools with grants is to have enough school facilities in walking distance within urban housing areas. Grants will include the ability to purchase many houses in neighborhoods and turn them into schools, along with developing sport facilities.

Houses will be acquired by making offer on properties to willing sellers at 20-30% of value. These will be acquired and owned by the district and the DOE. If the district fails, the DOE will have the burden of selling it.

## Attendance

The DOE will have a jury system to deal with parents who are not sending their children to school. The laws around this will be defined and voted on at the department of education federally.

Each district must provide at least one special education class to handle all special education needs, to allow children who can't make it to school. The format of this school will be defined at the district level.

## Field Trip Transportation

Transportation will be available for field trips, and sporting events with other schools. There will be grants to provide transportation services on behalf of each district by the DOE.

## Supplies

The DOE will provide a platform to allow .school providers to receive supplies. The supplies will be categorized by class and skill path.

Reports will be available if .school's are receiving more product than normal.

## School Lunch

Lunch will be provided by the school by bidding out delivery of food services from the market place each week. The funding for lunches will be derived from grant money and will be part of the budget the district submits. Local businesses will be responsible for delivering it based on schedules where children meet for lunch.

The school's will have an approved list of food types from the that can be purchased under the school lunch program from the department of health.

# Use Case

I'm a teacher who is going to teach computer class, in core discovery.

I get a license to teach computer class based on my background by taking a test with a licensed training service for this foundation path.

I get my enrollment together, and apply for a grant to operate or fund privately.

Once funding is in hand, I goto the department of education, where I receive a .school domain name that is setup at Homeland Security. I then purchase a school container from a provider with the grant money. The .school domain is associated to a domain zone.

I then goto the state and get my supplies based on my enrolment numbers on the data in the system and provide the grant.
