# Department of Education

When registering a child for a school, you would login and register personal profiles to the school where you are legal guardian in your personal profile.

Instead of getting rid of the department of education, we will develop curriculum standards in which schools who receive [grant](/grants/index.md) money for schooling will be able to access these application s.

The following must be provided from schools via an API to the department of education.

- Class Count
- Teacher Count
- Teach Assistant count
- Grades per class category

Also all grades, teacher notes, study work and all other information will be sent to the parents personal profile.

The department of education will also develop a medical application that will ensure people get their vaccines based on the appropriate schedule.
