# Department of Education

The state education systems will be a local grant voted on by the citizens.

We will have .school domains for people managing the schools, where they will have an API to:

    - Enroll children
    - Provide grades to personal profiles
    - Provide children's work
    - Provide domains for schools authorized by the state education system which will be a .book, .study-guide, and .field-work domain based on the school type they are

.school domains will be authorized by the state education system to ensure all curriculum and field work are inline where it will be solidified each calendar year.
