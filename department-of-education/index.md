# Department of Education

Instead of getting rid of the department of education, we will develop curriculum standards in which schools who receive [grant](/grants/index.md) money must follow.

We will also develop a platform that ensures that when children are attending school, that they are meeting the requirements of these standards across various schools.

The first grant will be mountain bike educators where curriculum be defined.
