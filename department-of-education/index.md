## Grant Money

Actual schools will apply to provide .school services from their district and get licensed.

Once licensed, each school will apply for a grant based on their credentials for the next 4 years.

Each state will have student credit requirements for all the required subjects. These subject include:

- History
- Art
- Math
- Computer Science
- English
- Physical Education
- Music

Each school the person attends will apply those credits to the students profile at the department of education at the state level using the federally provided software application.

Schools will be licensed based on:

- Certifications of teachers
- Facilities
- Course materials
- Schedule

An API must be enabled for a .school which includes:

- Apply for Enrolment
- Books
- Schedules

Each school will be responsible for their own course material that is approved by the district school, and ultimately the state.

All education statistics will be sent to the department of education at all levels above, and then the personal profile.

## School Location Objective

The objective of having many schools with grants is to have enough school facilities in walking distance from housing. Grants will include the ability to purchase many houses in neighborhoods and turn them into schools, along with having access to sport facilities.

Reporting and maps will be available to evaluate this by each state to the federal level.

## Field Trip Transportation

Transportation will be available for field trips, and sporting events with other schools. There will be grants to provide transportation services on behalf of each district at the state level.

## User Interfaces

Grades will be provided to the personal profile in an JSON format, or provided in open document format to viewed.

Schools will provide websites to students for course material, this would be emailed at various frequencies throughout the year.

## School Lunch

Lunch will be provided by the school by bidding out delivery of food services from the market place each week. The funding for lunches will be derived from grant money and will be part of the budget the district submits to the state. Local businesses will be responsible for delivering it based on schedules.
