# Department of Education

Instead of getting rid of the department of education, we will develop curriculum standards in which schools who receive [grant](/grants/index.md) money for schooling must follow.

We will develop a platform that ensures that when children are attending school, that they are meeting the requirements of these standards across various schools.

A directory of .schools will be the domains providing school services.

All schools must pass a school plan approval by the school board on how they are meeting the curriculum of the group in their standard grades which is:

- Elementary School
- Middle School
- High School

The education system will include a visit to the doctors office for the entry of each time the citizen is registered to a group, where vaccine and other health decisions can be discussed.

A grant will be provided to all cities that:

    - Provide a bus service for all .school domains in their [Application Zone](/USA-Internet/juristiction-zones/).

The following must be provided from schools via an API to the department of education.

- Class Count
- Teacher Count
- Grades per class category.
