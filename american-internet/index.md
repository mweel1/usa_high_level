# Preface

The internet has become an untrustworthy service for the citizens of the United States. These issues range from:

- Financial fraud
- Misinformation
- Election interference from foreign actors
- Unregulated age restrictions
- Fraudulent email addresses
- Non-revokable domains

Additionally, we rely on corporations like Google to protect users from monopolized content. The original intent of the internet was exploration, productivity and innovation. The vision for the United States internet will be to restore this.

# United States Internet

A new domain system would be provided which would need a country code would be needed when resolving DNS. For example usa:whitehouse.gov.

If no country code is defined the world wide DNS system is used, otherwise the countries DNS system is used.

The United States DNS system be built with a new design architecture that will include new registering requirements and provide licensing services that would issue licenses and revoke them if requirements were not met for [personal license and business licenses](/licensing-agency/).

## Operating System Requirements

Operating systems that operate on the USA Internet must provide the following during DNS resolution:

- Enforce age requirements using [gov.id authorization](/government-os-services/id-gov/).
- Each domain type will have a terms of service template that must be met.
- Link to cancellation policies for the domain.
- Link to file complaints in domain claims court to resolve dispute with domain owners.
- Provide domain claims court case resolutions that have occurred in the past.
- Provide a list of review sites chosen by the domain owner (at least 3) from the directory.
- Show a special icon when a domain or e-mail is from a .gov agency.

## Domain Protection

A [Content Filtering and Security Service](/content-filtering-and-security-service) will use AI technology to:

- Ensure all user-generated content posted to a business API or personal API is checked and tagged.
- Crawl domains and ensure all meta-content is safe.

## DNS Requirements

- The DNS will track all requests made, and caching will be considered illegal, one of the major tenants of the American Internet is to find content based on its popularity derived from DNS requests.

## Application Zones

Any domain registered to the American Internet must be associated to one or many [application zones](/application-zones/), where domain information can be queried when people press a button on their operating system to get specific applications depending on where they are located when pressing a button on their phone.

## Personal Licenses

Licensed domains are public-facing domains that require licenses to be issued and maintained. Each licenses domain includes a free e-mail address which can be revoked in domain court.

You can start to imagine all types professions using these licensing procedures married with educational program.

Any software products that provide service for these licensed professionals would have to check their e-mail address during the login process to ensure their license is still valid and issued.

Here are a number examples of domain names that would enable users to provide services on the internet in a licensed way.

- Doctor (Physician)
- Lawyer
- Nurse (RN, LPN, Nurse Practitioner)
- Pharmacist
- Physical Therapist
- Psychologist
- Veterinarian
- Chiropractor
- Optometrist
- Architect
- Engineer (various branches)
- Real Estate Agent/Broker
- Certified Public Accountant (CPA)
- Teacher
- Electrician
- Plumber
- Pilot (Commercial and Private)
- Insurance Agent
- Barber/Hairdresser
- Massage Therapist
- Funeral Director/Embalmer
- Cosmetologist
- Esthetician
- Occupational Therapist
- Acupuncturist
- Podiatrist
- Dietitian/Nutritionist
- Land Surveyor
- Judge
- AI Technician

Some domain names to prevent mis-information, and national security threats on-line would

- Journalist - A journalist who is licensed to provide journalism to the market place.
- Press - A person of the press that would be providing press information.
- Influencer - A person that is influencing a large part of the population with media.

An API would be available for licensed domains to keep track of any attributes that are needed for the licensing and would possibly be private and/or public based on the licensing type.

The licensing agency [licensing agency](/licenseing-agency) will manage the licensing processes and would have access to the American Internet to revoke and issue emails.

## Directory

The directory of the American Domain System would be publicly available along with query counts for the domain with various filter types (today, last year, etc.). Any domain name registered can choose not to be part of the directory if they so choose.

## Legal

Validation of all operating system releases, browsers, and e-mails clients are required to ensure that all services meet applicable laws and regulations during the [OS and application certification process](/os-certificiation-process/)

## Domain Claims Court

The Domain Claims Court is a jury based system where complaints are processed and managed.

For example, the domains claims court would the authority to do the following if terms of service, or cancellation policies were not being offered correctly:

- Warn domain owners.
- Fine domain owners.
- Shut down domains.
- Revoke a government ID holder's ability to operate domains in the future on the United States internet.

The domain court would find jury selections using the Jury services/[/jury-services].

## System to System Standards

The main goals of the American Internet would be to ensure that open [system to system standards](/grants/system-to-system-standards/) are created to allow:

- business to business (b2b)
- business to consumer (b2c)
- government to consumer (g2c)
- government to business (g2b)
- government to government (g2g)
