# Preface

The internet has become an untrustworthy service for the citizens of the United States. These issues range from:

- Financial fraud
- Misinformation
- Election interference from foreign actors
- Unregulated age restrictions
- Fraudulent email addresses
- Non-revokable domains

Additionally, we rely on corporations like Google to protect users from monopolized content. The original intent of the internet was exploration, productivity and innovation. The vision for the United States internet will restore this.

# United States Domain System (USDS)

A new domain system would be provided which would add a country, state a code at the beginning of each domain. For example us.www.whitehouse.gov.

If no country code is defined the normal DNS system is used, otherwise the countries DNS system is used.

The United States DNS system be built with a new design architecture that will include new registering requirements and provide licensing services that would be issue license and revoke them if requirements were not met.

## Operating System Requirements

Operating systems that operate on the USA Internet must provide the following during DNS resolution:

- Enforce age requirements using [gov.id authorization](/government-os-services/id-gov/).
- Each domain type will have a terms of service template that must be met.
- Link to cancellation policies for the domain.
- Link to file complaints against the domain owner.
- Link to file complaints in domain claims court to resolve dispute with domain owners.
- Provide domain claims court case resolutions.
- Provide a list of review sites chosen by the domain owner (at least 3) from the registry.
- Show a certification when an e-mail is from a .gov agency.

## Domain Protection

A [Content Filtering and Security Service](/content-filtering-and-security-service) will be use AI technology to:

- Ensure all user-generated content posted to a business API or personal API is checked and tagged.
- Crawl domains to ensure content that has not been checked is safe on an ongoing basis, priorities will be based on how popularity is trending.

## DNS Requirements

- The DNS will track all requests made, and caching is illegal.

## Licensed Domains

Licensed domains are public-facing domains that require licenses to be issued and maintained. Each licenses domain includes a free e-mail address which can be revoked in domain court.

You can start to imagine all types professions using these licensing procedures married with educational program.

Here are a number examples of domain names that would enable users to provide services on the internet in a licensed way.

- Doctor (Physician)
- Lawyer
- Nurse (RN, LPN, Nurse Practitioner)
- Pharmacist
- Physical Therapist
- Psychologist
- Veterinarian
- Chiropractor
- Optometrist
- Architect
- Engineer (various branches)
- Real Estate Agent/Broker
- Certified Public Accountant (CPA)
- Teacher
- Electrician
- Plumber
- Pilot (Commercial and Private)
- Insurance Agent
- Barber/Hairdresser
- Massage Therapist
- Funeral Director/Embalmer
- Cosmetologist
- Esthetician
- Occupational Therapist
- Acupuncturist
- Podiatrist
- Dietitian/Nutritionist
- Land Surveyor

Some domain names to prevent mis-information, and national security threats on-line would

- Journalist - A journalist who is licensed to provide journalism to the market place.
- Press - A person of the press that would be providing press information.
- Influencer - A person that is influencing a large part of the population with media.

An API would be available for licensed domains to keep track of any attributes that are needed for the licensing and would possibly be private and/or public based on the licensing type.

The licensing agency [licensing agency](/licenseing-agency) would have access to the American Internet to revoke and receive-emails.

## Legal

Validation of all operating system releases, browsers, and e-mails clients are required to ensure that all services meet applicable laws and regulations during the [OS and application certification process](/os-certificiation-process/)

## Domain Claims Court

The Domain Claims Court is a judge-based system where complaints are processed and managed. A [grant](/grants/) can be deployed to train judges on these procedures, making them available to the citzens.

For example, the domains claims court would the authority to:

- Warn domain owners.
- Fine domain owners.
- Shut down domains.
- Revoke a government ID holder's ability to operate domains in the future on the United States internet.

The domain court would find jury selections using the Jury services/[/jury-services].
