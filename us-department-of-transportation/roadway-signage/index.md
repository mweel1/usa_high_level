# Roadways and Signage

The DOT would provide grants to districts that would be in charge of managing all their map data that would include :

- Roadway Details
- Sidewalk Details
- Signage
- Traffic Patterns would come from both mobile phones, and vehicle operating systems via the GPS system where it would be provided down stream to jurisdictions for local use. Each district will have a .traffic-pattern domain to replicate data to based on the jurisdiction.

These jurisdictions must be cities or counties. A no overlap may be present.
