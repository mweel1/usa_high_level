## Vehicle Operating Systems

DOT will work with the NTIS where DOT will approve all vehicle operating system based on the requirements of NTIS.

The certificate process for vehicle operating systems will include:

    - Hardware Interface Validation: Ensuring compatibility with DOT-approved hardware components, including drive-by-wire systems, sensors, and control modules.

    - Secure Boot and Authorization: Verifying that the OS supports a secure boot process with containerized authorization mechanisms to prevent tampering and unauthorized access into the installed operating systems.

    - Emergency Communication Integration: Ensuring the system can send and receive emergency alerts in compliance with FCC and DOT protocols, including AMBER Alerts, vehicle crash notifications, and emergency vehicle notifications.

    - Over-the-Air (OTA) Update Integrity: Validating rollback capability, cryptographic verification of updates, and secure delivery through NTIS-certified servers.

    - Personal Profile Support: Confirming that user data, preferences, and credentials are securely stored and integrated through the social security Personal Profile framework.

    - AI and Sensor Fusion Certification: If AI is used for driver assistance or automation, verifying its compliance with DOT national safety standards, including object recognition and decision-making logic.

    - Local Dispatch and Incident Reporting: Ensuring vehicles can interact with local authorities or dispatch services during accidents or critical events.

    - Cybersecurity and Isolation: Testing for vulnerabilities, ensuring
    sandboxing of applications, and verifying the isolation of safety-critical functions from non-critical systems.
    - Children and Passenger Protection: Validating lockout functions, child safety zone enforcement, and digital guardian controls.

    - Compliance Logging and Auditing: Enabling transparent system logs for government and manufacturer review, including boot activity, update history, and safety-related events.
