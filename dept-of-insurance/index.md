# Department of Insurance

A federal department of insurance will be created at the federal level to manage the platform for the states.

This platform will enables sales and service agents to offer and service insurance.

We will develop best practices for claim management, fraud and the various functions of selling insurance and provide it to agents.

We will provide market analysis of coverage by any location to help agents find markets.

We will provide ranges of insurance costs based on the financial's of people in various markets.

The platform will have all fraud controls that the market currently posses today. However, since its a unified platform more capabilities will exist to find fraud.
