Dear Possible Business Partner,

Most people call me Marty. I began working with technology at the age of 11, learning to develop software on bulletin board systems (BBS) that were used globally. After school, I briefly worked on a project at Microsoft before starting my own business. Over the years, I have worked in various domains, including supply chain management, media and entertainment, artificial intelligence, and payment processing. I also hold several patents in these areas.

During a devastating fire in my neighborhood, I took an active role in helping my community recover and was later asked to serve on the local parks and recreation board, eventually being elected on the Obama ticket.

While serving, I swore to uphold the Constitution, which created a passion within me to explore how technology could provide essential services to citizens. This opened my eyes to opportunities that I believe few have fully considered, I became very vocal in the community and started to write down my ideas. I would then start posting them on Facebook, or trying to get a hold of people to talk about it but nobody ever answered. After many attempts about telling the authorities and acting out with frustration, I just isolated in myself and went into deep studies. During my time in these institutions, I organized and refined my ideas, convinced that technology could revolutionize how public services are delivered. Upon release, I found myself at a halfway house, where I developed software for a company my brother worked at, slowly getting back on my feet. However, I remained driven by the need to solidify my vision for technological innovation in government.

The ideas I propose are a direct response to many many years of dealing with my ideas in isolation, while fighting against the America's big tech sector. This proposal outlines technology-driven solutions aimed at improving government services and addressing public sector challenges.

In office, I did a deal with our local government ([https://smrpd.org/](https://smrpd.org/)) for a $.01 they would get everything I did here.

I would like the USA to help me compensated based on what happened here.

Please visit the [impact report](/impact-report) for priority and market impacts for political discussions with the government if you would like to work on this, or extradite me to another country where I can receive safe harbor.

Best Regards,

Marty
Proud American
