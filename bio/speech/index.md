# Speech

I was elected out in the mountains in Silverado, CA for parks and recreation and started to be harassed by various technology companies for developing standards that would open up the market place.

I literally couldn’t send e-mails, post on social networks, use my i-phone. It was an all-out assault on the technology companies against me. It got so bad; I couldn’t operate in society and did some crimes just so I could go to jail and be taken care of. I would go the police for help, and they didn’t know how to help. I thought if I did more and more bigger crimes they would listen, nothing happened. They couldn’t help me.

Why can't our local police officer run a trace on what computers all my traffic go to from?

Did time for 2 years straight, and studied more about how government could help its citizens through technology standards – so their plan backfired. 10 Hours straight, 2 years straight, pencil and paper.

I then got back into a non-governmental role building software, and everything has been fine for a few years…

However, all those ideas came back, and I started documenting and fighting with these organizations again…

then it started again…. Hacking cards, hotels, social networks, they own it all…

My goal for this meeting is to convince you the American people that what I am doing what is right for America and its citizens.

Now let’s get into some problems with the tech industry as we know it today…

1st Lets talk about the Internet

- Children pornographic material
- Fraud
- No Repercussions for bad behavior
- Other countries/public-opinion/elections

We need an American Internet where:

- America issues domains
- Enforce
- American Only - people outside of the country apply for visa – Revoke Visa
- If you act badly, you will be put in front of your peers in a jury and be fined, or worse lose the ability to operate on the Internet.

Multi-national technology companies don’t want this because they are using the Internet to continue an agenda with the philosophy of global commerce instead of American commerce, or even better what I am trying to achieve here local commerce!

2nd I want you to start to think about how we use applications today.

- We download applications today and …
- How about if we pressed a button and…

Lets think about Laguna Beach Applications ….

How about Maps?

- Artists would design the map, and we will have integration into phone companies and vehicle operating systems to show traffic patterns in our local city, show the location of the trolly.

Business Directory?

What about that? Today we type into Google and bombarded to just get a business name, phone number, and a website.

How about shopping?

- Single button to shop all stores in town + the Amazon’s and Best Buy’s of the world.

How about ordering food?

- Order Food Button

- Today’s apps are confusing to the customer

- They are difficult for the restaurants to

How about ordering a Taxi?

- Now we have 2 companies doing this Uber and Lyft?

- Doesn’t that sound like a monopoly?

- Impact of that monopoly getting fixed…

- So we need all of them behind a .taxi domain so we can send requests to get picked up, the bartender could use that API also.

That was fun talking about city stuff, let’s think about where we are now…

- We could order a drink
- Although a small place, we could get a map of the place and find out where restrooms are.
- If someone is drinking too much and bothering, you could call security by using the security application
- When a band is playing you could provide donations
- When a band is playing you could download songs
- If there was a DJ, you could request songs.
- Play the juke box with our music collection and have many jukebox owners.

So, all kinds of fun exciting new opportunities at various levels of context from the Federal government all the way to a business here in Laguna.

3rd I want you to start to think about supply chain’s and connecting businesses.

Why isn’t our local supply chain integrated?

Why can’t the deli talk to the sandwich shop to look at inventory and order processing?

Why can’t the food ordering app place an order at every business in Laguna?

Why can’t every business in Laguna talk to each other via standard application interfaces?

It should be a law, and we should create the standards for it on this American Internet and let other cities follow.

4th I want you to start to think about your personal information.

Why don’t we own our own data?

We continue to enter the same information into these forms repeatedly.

Putting our driver licenses, credit cards, resumes should all be in your own server so we can share it with anything.

If you go to a site like indeed it would just ask if you would like to share your resume, and you would say yes. You wouldn’t enter it a 100 times to 100 different job sites. It’s ridiculous.

These wall gardens with our data in corporate silos are having devastating effects on the marketplace.

Think about all the information we should own in our own personal servers:

1. Our Government Identification
2. Credit Cards
3. Electronic Check Cards
4. Housing Information
5. Receipts
6. Medical Events
7. Media (Books, Music, TV Shows, Movies)
8. Contacts
9. Calendar
10. Incoming Deliveries
11. Accounts Payable
12. Vehicle Keys

Many of these things are locked into our phone, and they don’t work in the marketplace because of proprietary standards.

5th Children Devices, how many parents are having trouble controlling your children’s time on all the various devices they own?

This again is just a lack of standards.

We need a universal app that we can control and view what our children are doing all the time on all devices.

Lets put on our government hats now...

Questions?

Why do corporations own all the data about this community?

We have a census system in our government, lets build this up and start querying the public a bit better for the betterment of the community online. All jurisdictions could use this.

They come to our door every 4 years to collect data, why couldn’t we reach out to the population here in Laguna and ask:

- What is your pet population at your house in case of an emergency?

All these types of requests would run through this.

Let’s talk about taxes…

What is our goal as citizens paying taxes?

So why don’t we just vote directly on these organizations for doing their job?

Let’s talk about a public bathroom government… Social network type interface for approvals… Voting capabilities every x amount of years …direct accountability between you and the citizen.

What about inflation? It would be easy for us to just create governments and pay each other right? That would create inflation?

All government agencies would have quantifiable results we would try and compare with other jurisdiction, and if there weren't other jurisdictions doing it we would take note in a good way or bad way.

Lets talk about TV…

How many different operating systems do we have on there?

Apple TV, Samsung….

Content is in multiple walled gardens, and its very difficult to manage subscriptions. There is 3 ways to pay for the NFL right now, 3.

Using the American Domain system will put all these players in their correct place and organize this, all TV programming will be domain driven.

So if the NFL wants to play a game put it on nfl.com and all our devices could play this with a subscription, or pay with a real-time American Electronic E-Check Network.

If you doing news, you will have a .news domain either all the way up to the federal level, to the local level.

if you’re the NFL you will have an NFL.Sports domain at the federal level.

If you’re the local baseball team you will have a laguna-highscool.sports domain, and all the places will know how to view the games of the school and play it with ease.

I can buy football in 3 different places right now, and quite frankly it’s a bit a confusing.

When there are subscription services, they will all be in your personal profile with the ability to cancel with a click a button.

Lets talk about local emergency services…

Fire department, police department why cant you easily send a request to the FBI in the area and get all the cell phones for someone who witnessed a mugging and reach out to the citizens via e-mail?

Why can’t our lifeguard send an alert to the beach that a shark is present, or dangerous conditions are developing?

Why cant the police department get alerted when someone is violating a restraining order?

Swat team when you go into an area with guns why is the shelter in place not showing up on all the devices in the house from the refrigerator, mobile phone and gaming systems?

Why can’t the police department create a geo fence around a disruptive group of people and ask them kindly to leave.

Deploy applications in emergency operation zones…

Notify all devices

Deploy applications to get status across all devices

What happened to public service announcements from our government?

Where are the notifications on Tik Tok, Social Networks, You Tube, the local TV stations about…

Riding e-bikes?
Trail ediciate?
Kids using their phones when walking in public?

All levels of government, based on context.

Let’s talk about vehicles,

There is a war going on between the car manufactures and the mobile handset companies in most car brands.

Apple is making in-roads into the vehicle, but where are the standards between the vehicle display, and control system and the vehicle?

Why can’t anyone here build an operating system for a car and get it licensed on the telematics domain name if they meet safety and control standards?

I want to end with this, the future of good technology is local areas business systems integrated and their personal servers communicating for a seamless experience with the market.

I’d like everyone to get out their phone tonight and call Homeland Security which has been printed at the door and let them know these ideas are good for American and local cities like Laguna Beach.

If that succeeds, I would like to work with the city of Laguna Beach, and ..

1. Ensure every government, business and person is able to communicate with each other. Your phone will work seamlessly with juke boxes, and ticketing services in town.
2. Ensure our local government can integrate with state, and federal agencies.
3. Work with the FCC to ensure these standards are deployed to Apple, and Google to ensure our personal information and our wallet is with us, not cooped up in a corporate silo where its unable to work within the marketplace.
4. Work with Laguna Beach and build the first app launcher for a city, and all the businesses here. This will be an incredible experience.
5. Work with America and ensure that each time a new standard is put in place its available for America to do the same in other towns.
6. Break up the city government into many organizations that we can all monitor and vote on and get rid of local taxes much like a social network.
7. Receive a bank fund from the federal reserve in which local banks will operate on open standards with a commitment to funding and revitalizing buildings and local businesses. The will operate with ACH standards just like all banks do in America.
8. We will have a city technology group that will be voted on by grant that I will operate, along with collaboration with federal technology grants that roll-up.
9. I will work with the federal government and ensures this operating system where the wallet has been removed from the phone only works in Laguna Beach and other jurisdictions that use this technology. Google & Apple this is your future market place, your dead on delivery with these wall gardened information this ours.
   Thank you for coming out tonight, and I would love to answer any questions you might have.
