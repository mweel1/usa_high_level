Dear Fellow Constituent,

Most people call me Marty. I began working with technology at the age of 11, learning to develop software on bulletin board systems (BBS) that were used globally. After school, I briefly worked on a project at Microsoft before starting my own business. Over the years, I have worked in various domains, including supply chain management, media and entertainment, artificial intelligence, and payment processing. I also hold several patents in these areas.

During a devastating fire in my neighborhood, I took an active role in helping my community recover and was later asked to serve on the local parks and recreation board, eventually being elected on the Obama ticket.

While serving, I swore to uphold the Constitution, which created a passion within me to explore how technology could provide essential services to citizens. This opened my eyes to opportunities that I believe few have fully considered. However, this journey was not without challenges, as the scope of innovation overwhelmed me, leading to personal struggles, including paranoia and mental health challenges that resulted in stints in jail and mental health institutions.

During my time in these institutions, I organized and refined my ideas, convinced that technology could revolutionize how public services are delivered. Upon release, I found myself at a halfway house, where I developed software for a company my brother worked at, slowly getting back on my feet. However, I remained driven by the need to solidify my vision for technological innovation in government.

The ideas I propose are a direct response to many many years of dealing in this domain. This proposal outlines technology-driven solutions aimed at improving government services and addressing public sector challenges.

I am providing this to you first because I respect the compassion we all have to make the United States a better country for its citizens and I would like you to help me garner as much support as possible for any of these projects you agree with.

In office, I did a deal with our local government ([https://smrpd.org/](https://smrpd.org/)) for a $.01 they would get everything I do.

I would like to be the CTO of America with a salary of 7M a year and make a stand in that I would rather get paid for my job, then get paid by favors from the public market. In doing so, I would like to have the best internet a country can build and offer it to other countries where our debt can be cleared with trading partners in exchange for technology.

Best Regards,
