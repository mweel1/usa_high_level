Hi,

I'm asking for help -- I've been targeted by big-tech for trying to develop these solutions to for the government and I am having trouble getting a hold of the right people.

What I am working on right now are:

**Personal Data Sovereignty:** Each citizen will receive a government-backed personal server to securely store their social security information and other official government information, removing dependence on private corporations and their wall gardened initiatives.

**American DNS System:** Implement an American DNS system with governance and licensing which will hold citizens accountable for online crimes.

**Enforce our Government ID System:** Integrate all government ID's to work online and enforce age restrictions at at the domain level, we have to have age protection across the entire American Internet not just on YouTube and Apple.

**Youth Protection:** Develop universal parental controls across all children's devices with screen time recommendations. We will have the capability to press a button on your phone, turn off your kids device and have them do chores or something.

**Domain Zones:** Replace the QR Code code that you scan in facilities with a simple press of a button where multiple applications will come up based on your location. This technology will bring billions, if not trillions in market place value when combined with local B2B networks.

**Digital Rights Protection:** Reinvent copyright systems to give individuals control over their digital works on the American Internet.

**Surveillance Transparency:** Establish clear constitutional guidelines for government and tech industry surveillance, and provide the security through the personal profile to allow it in an open forum. The patriot act should be removed, if we are not safe by now from terrorist our government didn't do their job.

**Grant Management System:** Implement a platform to manage grants across all government levels, addressing issues like homelessness. Not with just money, but with a technology platform that drives accountability and traceability from the federal level to the local with its citizens.

**Education Reform:** Support lower student-teacher ratios and community-based schools through the Department of Education unified platform and grant system.

**Simplified User Interfaces on Devices:** Develop standards so there is only one operating system on our TV's and in our cars. Your not alone in being confused.

**Public Emergency**: We will bring public emergency organizations in-line with the capabilities of people having cell phones.

Please call the president and recommend me at
