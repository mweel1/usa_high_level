Dear Friends,

Dear Laguna Beach Police department,

I was arrested on multiple counts around Orange County after reporting to the authorities that my communications were hacked, no investigation or follow-up on the issue.

Iâ€™d like you to go through all the dispositions I took about it, and what investigations were taken.
