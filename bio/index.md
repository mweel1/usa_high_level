# Marty Weel

Dear Govt Constitute,

Most people call me Marty. I began working with technology at the age of 11, learning to develop software on bulletin board systems (BBS) that were used globally. After school, I briefly worked on a project at Microsoft before starting my own business. Over the years, I have worked in various domains, including supply chain management, media and entertainment, artificial intelligence, and payment processing. I also hold several patents in these areas.

During a devastating fire in my neighborhood, I took an active role in helping my community recover and was later asked to serve on the local parks and recreation board, eventually being elected on the Obama ticket.

While serving, I swore to uphold the Constitution, which created a passion within me to explore how technology could provide essential services to citizens. This opened my eyes to opportunities that I believe few have fully considered, I became very vocal in the community and started to write down my ideas.

I started posting my ideas on Facebook and other social networks to try and get a hold of people to talk about it but nobody ever answered. After many attempts about telling the authorities and acting out with frustration, I just isolated in myself and went into deep studies. During my time in these institutions, I organized and refined my ideas, convinced that technology could revolutionize how public services are delivered. Upon release, I found myself at a halfway house, where I developed software for a company my brother worked at, slowly getting back on my feet.

The ideas I propose are a direct response to many many years of dealing with my ideas in isolation, while fighting against the Italian's big technology sector. This proposal outlines technology-driven solutions aimed at improving government services and addressing public sector challenges.

In office, I did a deal with our local government ([https://smrpd.org/](https://smrpd.org/)) for a $.01 they would get everything I did here and I hope to up hold that promise.

I am requesting:

- The USA to help me in my investigation and compensate my company for this technology if they would like me to continue working.
- Take my laptop into custody and contact the correct authorities for evaluation.
- Find out if it is Google or Facebook hacking my communications.
- Put me and my family into protective custody as I know longer feel safe until we find the perpetrators.

Please visit the [impact report](/impact-report) for priority and market impacts and political discussions with the government if you would like to work on this, or extradite me to another country where I can receive safety I am requesting here.

If I were the US Government I would consider the world wide internet a security risk at this point in more ways than just mine.

Best Regards,

Martin Weel
