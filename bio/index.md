Hi,

I'm asking for help, and applying to be the Chief Technology Officer of the United States and seek your support for my vision to modernize the United States role in the domain of technology.

We are being left behind by corporate America -- and they will take over the function of government for our government in technology functions if we don't build for our government.

My Key Objectives over 10 Years:

**Personal Data Sovereignty:** Each citizen will receive a government-backed personal server to securely store their social security information and other official government information, removing dependence on private corporations and their wall gardened initiatives.

**American DNS System:** Implement an American DNS system with governance and licensing which will hold citizens accountable for online crimes.

**Enforce our Government ID System:** Integrate all government ID's to work online and enforce age restrictions at at the domain level, we have to have age protection across the entire American Internet not just on YouTube and Apple.

**Youth Protection:** Develop universal parental controls across all children's devices with screen time recommendations. We will have the capability to press a button on your phone, turn off your kids device and have them do chores or something.

**Domain Zones:** Replace the QR Code code that you scan in places with a simple press of a button where multiple applications will come up based on your location. This technology will bring billions, if not trillions in market place value when combined with local B2B networks.

**Digital Rights Protection:** Reinvent copyright systems to give individuals control over their digital works.

**Surveillance Transparency:** Establish clear constitutional guidelines for government and tech industry surveillance, and provide the security through the personal profile to allow it in an open forum.

**Grant Management System:** Implement a platform to manage grants across all government levels, addressing issues like homelessness. Not with just money, but with a technology platform that drives accountability and traceability from the federal level to the local.

**Education Reform:** Support lower student-teacher ratios and community-based schools through the Department of Education unified platform and grant system.

**Simplified User Interfaces on Devices:** Develop standards so there is only one operating system on our TV's and in our cars. Your not alone in being confused.

This technology didn't come easily, I have been at odds with big-tech that is why you are receiving this via paper. I have no communication capability on-line with my government and need your help.

Please call Homeland Security at (202) 282-8000 and provide them with my phone number at (949)537-1738, so we can investigate who these multi-national technology companies are.

The irony is, I'm not sure our country even has the capability to do such research as we use a corporate DNS system not an American one.

These bad technology corporations are more powerful, more equipped, and that is the problem.

The United States government will re-insert itself in the technology dialog with good American corporation's that share this vision.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you call for not only my families sake, but for our countries sake.
