# Product Safety Agency

The product safety agency would make it easy for citizens to report issues with products they purchase in the market place.

We would provide a law that all receipts must go to the bank in which the transactions takes place.

All banks would provide receipt to the USA.

All medical records would be stored.

Citizens can notify the Product Safety Agency in a case of food sickness, allergy or other unsafe actions occur with their purchases.

We would start comparing receipts and medical records to find issues in the market place to keep the public safe.
