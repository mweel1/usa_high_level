# Safe Passage

Will be a grant and product provided to the cities that reduce homelessness by:

1. Setting up mental intuitions for the community
2. Providing support services when police interact with mentally-ill to place them at the mental intuitions.
3. Provide placement services from jail to mental health intuitions, or transitional housing.
