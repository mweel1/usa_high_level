# Trade Data Services

The trade school data services would:

- Align food stamp and other social network programs with requirements for trade school attendance.
- Grants to educate children on trade school trades where the country is lacking skills.
- Ensure schools are accountable for their placement of students into the business with data of success.
- Train AI from ivy schools, license it to trade schools to help with education, or not.
