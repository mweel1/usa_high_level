# Overview

Social Security will have a platform that will enact and vote on laws around social security. It will also provide social security services at the federal level, and the local level via social security districts.

Our country offers a variety of public assistance programs, such as food stamps and Social Security, aimed at supporting individuals in need.

To enhance the effectiveness of these programs, I propose consolidating them into Social Security's platform. This would allow for better data collection, providing a clearer understanding of the publicâ€™s needs, and ensuring that support is delivered more efficiently and equitably to those who require it most.

## Personal Profile

The social security office will manage the [personal profile](./personal-profile/). A personal profile is a citizens wallet where all government documents will be placed, and shared with the market place.

## Social Services

### Retirement

Social Security districts will manage the social security payouts from the 33-66% percentile of the district in the last 10 years.

The retirement age will be voted on federally. Each age up/down will have inflationary effect by % on costs that need to be provided to the public.

All retirement laws, must be approved by the federal board.

### Out of Money

People would be able to apply for social security if they had no income before retirement age, which would include enough for:

- Local shelter housing
- Food and groceries
- Storage costs
- Trade School (for 6 months)

Social Security would ensure they were looking for jobs. If they failed to after a year of time, and jobs were available you would be placed in a .social-housing-center where they would take care of you. This would include:

- Shelter
- Eat at the house kitchen
- Storage costs

### Domain Zone

A domain zone application will be managed at federal and local levels to allow people to report people in need where social workers would deployed and take them to .social-care-centers with licensed social workers.

### On-Line Reporting

Furthermore, links would be available on social networks to report people that need help. All social networks must have a back channel for social security where an ID is passed in the link to social security, and a callback is made to receive the actual persons personal profile.
