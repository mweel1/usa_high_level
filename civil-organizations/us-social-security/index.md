# Overview

Social Security will have a platform that will enact and vote on laws around social security.

Management will bring up votes, community cannot.

Social Security will be broken up by city, and based on the medium income of the city that you lived in most of your life, as the 33-66% percentile.

Citizens voting is based on the city they spent most of their life in.

Retirement age will be voted on. Each age up/down will have inflationary effect by % on all costs.

No voting is available on actual amounts of payments.

- Storage Costs
