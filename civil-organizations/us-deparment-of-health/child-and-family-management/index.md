# Child and Family Management

The department of child and family management would provide grants to districts to manage the laws and services for child and family management.

The services would include:

1. Managing the handoff from DOJ for children that are separated from their families.
2. Voting on Family Laws which would include:

   - Who could receive marriage certificates
   - What constitutes a family and its participants.
   - Income to have children/dependents
   - Adoption Laws

- All licensed realtors would have to ensure people moving into real-estate districts followed all district laws.
- The DOJ in districts would have the right to remove people breaking district laws.

3. Manage all orphanages for children under 18.
