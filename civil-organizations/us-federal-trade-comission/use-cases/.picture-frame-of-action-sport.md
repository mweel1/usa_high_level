# Picture Frame of Action Sports

I would get the UL certified picture frame, the picture frame would be licensed to show x amount of pictures per day based on its usage.

In the case of a restaurant we would have a vote at the FTC, where that would be placed on a business permit requirement at BA.

Touch Bluetooth to a web server.

Get a directory of .action-sport-photographers in order of domain zone by miles.

I would pay for a per picture by the minute.
