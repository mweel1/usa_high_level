# Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)

Department of Federal Rail Administration would provide the infrastructure to manage train lines, technology, licensing, and grant money to:

- Ship cargo
- Livestock
- Transport People

## Ownership

The FRA would start with the Pacific Surfliner. It's goal would be to:

- Development of new tracks
- Development of existing tracks
- Provide technology platform to allow cargo, and Transportation services on various lines.
- Pay for gas
- Maintenance of Trains
- Development of cargo depot outside of passenger stations
- Extend the lines down through Mexico and support both passenger and cargo transports, where manufacturing will occur.
- Ensure e-VISA technologies are deployed at the passenger depot points.

## Cargo

Cargo districts would be based on loading points, and exiting points for cargo.

In these districts, the train transportation would allow you to buy various cargo types on the rail system for a price by bidding it out the various cargo types. The price would be from one port to another.

All cargo containers would be part of the district and shippers and receivers would receive a credit and debit for the cargo when they take them off the rails, or put them on. Cargo carts will be available in cargo lots around ports with a open system to make assignments.

All cargo will be matched up with shippers if cargo containers do not make them back to the yard they will be charged for the cargo containers.

The first district would be from Mexico to Leucadia.
The second district would be from Leucadia to San Juan Capistrano.

In this first district, cargo containers would not be removed from the train, but split containers in half. Products would be removed the cargo containers and put on to trucks and then moved to retail operations.

Retail owners would purchase product from owners of cargo containers. This would be accomplished by going to the originating port purchasing product, paying for it (w/ or without terms).

The retail operation would select their own delivery from the destination port to the retail location.

## Passenger Lines

The passenger line tickets would be purchased by going to the depot on a map, or searching for it and purchasing a ticket. The ticket would go into your personal profile and via touch RFID passengers would board the train.

Technology could be used to ask for their location and if they went past their destination an alert would be sent to the attendant to discuss the situation with the customer.

Passenger lines would have cars for food and entertainment for long trips.

## Transition of Am Track

- Receive a grant from the FRA for acquisition of Amtrack.
- Create the switch lines between passenger and new cargo rails.
- Attach GPS to all rails vehicles, and put a secure API on all switches and run a control system on a schedule.
- Develop a tracking system where all cargo, and its containers are secure from tampering.
