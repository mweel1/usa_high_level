# U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) – Real Estate Regulatory Proposal

Overview

This proposal outlines a federal initiative led by HUD to centralize and regulate the real estate market, including ownership restrictions, title management, real estate licensing, construction licensing, and rental agreements.

# Home Ownership Restrictions

• Propose and vote on a law, that only U.S. citizens will be permitted to own residential properties.
• Non-citizen ownership of real estate will be prohibited under HUD federal law.

# Title Management

• HUD will oversee the real estate title process nationwide.
• A title management system will be available to the market.

## Title Re-verification Requirements:

Local jurisdictions will be responsible for re-verifying all property titles. The process will include:

• Valid government-issued photo ID
• Proof of ownership (existing title)
• U.S. Passport

Based on the law, people not living in their house legally can be reported to ICE.

# Property Boundaries:

## Property boundaries will be re-documented through:

1. A physical walk of the property perimeter
2. A digital drawing on an official HUD-provided mapping tool

If a citizen is unable to prove ownership, a report will be submitted to the Department of Justice for investigation.

3. Real Estate Licensing

   • HUD will provide the education resources for real estate licenses to be received.

4. Rental Agreement Management

   • All rental agreements must be submitted through .realtor containers and reported to HUD.

   - HUD will provide rental agreements to the personal profile, where they can be verified by HUD.

# Licensing

HUD would manage all the licensing for :

- Construction Licensing

# Plan Approval Districts

HUD would manage plan approval districts where plans of housing would be approved. Licenses would be provided to .home-approval-agents along with a platform to submit plans, evaluate, collaborate, and approve and deny them.

HUD would provide the district a budget to hire approved licensed .home-approval-agents.

The districts would charge a processing fee.
