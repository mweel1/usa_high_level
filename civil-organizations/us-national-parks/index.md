# US National Parks

The US National Parks would handle all the park services for the country.

Including licensing, grants, and equipment.

I'd like to see a grant deployed for Modjeska to make a lake in the back of canyon for recreation, and other uses.

## Beaches

National Parks would provide grants for jurisdictions to manage beaches.
