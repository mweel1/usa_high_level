# News Media

A business network will be developed between article writers and media sites for journalism.

# Articles

People who write articles will provide an API under the directory of .article-writers.

Media sites can goto these article writing sites and setup an agreement and via an oAuth handshake. Once the oAuth handshake is completed an API will be available from the media site to the article writer to receive articles.

The agreement would include:

1. Profit share in the price to the customer
2. Share in ad revenue when viewing articles

# Pod Casts

All pod casts that were added to a .pod-cast container would have to include sources, and have a media license from the FTC.

# Ads

Media sites can also go to ad networks who are registered under .article-ads

They will oAuth and setup an agreement to provide adds on articles. The agreement will include:

1. The price per impression

Media sites must provide via the API the impressions of ads that are display on the content management system.

The ads must include their dimensions, and a standard set of dimensions will be available in the market place.

A content management system will allow people to organize the content from article writers, and ad providers for people to read.

Media sites, can show preview of articles and charge a price for the complete article using the [e-check system](/e-check/) or charge cards, or provide a subscription and pay based on the % of view on the articles and subscription income.
