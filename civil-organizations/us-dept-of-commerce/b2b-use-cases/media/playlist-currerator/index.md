# Playlist Curator

Need USA Domain system to start registering domains.

A container would be deployed for a .playlist-curator and added to the directory. A % rev share is completed with .content-providers with a play per stream, and purchase.

It would oAuth to .content-providers, and .network-providers where a public performance price would be charged.

Need Personal Profile to purchase music.

Need Domain Zone to. Use Now Playing Application. I am listening to the Playlist Playing application.

Debit System to pay for micro-transactions.
