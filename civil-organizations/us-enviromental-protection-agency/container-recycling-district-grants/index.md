## Container Recycling

Recycle Districts can be setup for any type of reusable container where grants can be provided for storage depots, and shared with any trading partner.

Containers could include:

- Packaging Containers
- Kegs for drinks
- Rail Road Containers
- Truck Cargo Containers

There are many use cases for recycling containers, from packaging to kegs for drinks.

When receiving a bill of lading, a container would be marked on to your account with the business.

When returning a container to a 3rd party or the storage depot, the container would be removed from your business.

These would be setup by business partners that shared in the value chain.

### Goal and Objectives

Packaging is a huge waste in this country. A grant will be deployed in all cities to manage the process of using re-usable containers. This could be one or many container depots.

Anytime a container is left at a location, the location will receive a debit on their points based on the size of the container.

Anytime a container leaves a location a point will be credited based on the size of the container.

If a location has to many containers, a pick up request can be made where the containers are moved to a container depot. The grant money includes people to pickup empty containers.

Containers goto a container depot where businesses can pick them up and have their points deducted.

All shipping applications must support the capability as part fo the bill of lading signature process.
