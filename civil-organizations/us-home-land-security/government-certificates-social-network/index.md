# Government Certificates and Social Security Network

# Social Network

## Functionality

Each organization will be available and added to the social network as education sites are brought up.

## Security

- Via single sign on a valid homeland security government license must be available in the personal profile, and validated at the home land security for authenticity.

- We will have a webhook active when certificates are removed.

# Issuing Government Certificates

When any government agency is created, they will get a certificate from homeland security with:

- Head Department
- Name
- Address
- Phone
- Domain Name
- Mission
- Top Level Government Organization (.gov)
- Personal Profiles of Board Members

Each department head in the government will have access to issue these licenses to the domain.

All domains must have a /licenses/government API end point to place them, where a callback to the homeland security must be handled to verify.

Anytime the certificate is used in the market, it must be verified with home land security certificate services.
