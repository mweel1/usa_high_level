# E-Bike Safety

DOT would provide a license to people to operate an e-bike on roads. This will include children and adults.

## General Requirements

- All manufacturers must put the lighting kit on their bikes when being sold that go over 15 MPH.
- All e-bikes must receive an e-bike DOT registration ID with RFID chip.
- All e-bikes must be registered to an owner.
- Bike owners can transfer bike ownership.
- Public citizens can scan the RFID chip and contact the owner.
- All e-bikes must be approved by a DOT licensed .e-bike-evaluator to receive a registration Id.
- E-Bikes must include peddles where they can operate manually.

## Children

- DOT would provide a license to kids to operate an e-bike on licensed bike paths, where maps would be available for the DOJ and the public to view.

- These bikes must not exceed 10 MPH.

## Adults

DOT will provide a directory of lighting kit suppliers for adults on-street where DOT educated,licensed mechanics can do the installs.

E-Bikes for licensed adults must not exceed 35 MPH.

E-Bikes are licensed for road use only, and not freeway.

All e-bikes sold that go under 15 to children, must provide a breaking capability and front light capability.

## Summary

This is the general guideline, we would start with an entire federal law, licensing, education and a directory of equipment vendors using the .e-bike-manufacture business operating system.
