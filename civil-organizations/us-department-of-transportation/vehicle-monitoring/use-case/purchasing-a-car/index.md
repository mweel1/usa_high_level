# Purchasing a Car

# Parents

I would goto a dealership. Purchase the car.

The manuf. would add the vehicle to my personal profile and vehicle operating system device, and provide me a passkey.

I would log into the manuf website where my personal profile would be associated to the vehicles I own.

Anytime someone logged into that vehicle via face rec. and were part of my monitoring list of the vehicle operating system device the owner would be able to use the child protection agency application to:

- Drivers logging in and out
- Monitor Speeds
- Monitor Location
- View contents of the device screen
- Receive media Ids that are being played

Furthermore, webhooks can be connected to receive GPS coordinates to a 3rd party service (fees would apply for messaging infrastructure)

# Businesses

A business would goto a dealership and purchase the car.

They would setup web-hooks for all the vehicle vitals based on its capabilities. Some examples would be:

- Drivers logging in and out
- Speed of vehicle
- Receive GPS Coordinates
- Steering Wheel Coordinates

A command set would be available with attributes that businesses would have available to capture via CQRS.

Further applications could be integrated to the businesses CQRS pipeline to do all kinds of monitoring of employees, etc.
