# Environmental Protection Agency

The environmental protection agency would provide trash management technologies and grants at all levels of government.

This would include:

1. Landfill Management
2. Recycling Operations
3. Local Community Trash Operations
4. Enforcement to change processes if better ones exist, and deal with funding gaps that may occur through grants
5. Demolition procedures, and recycling operations.
6. Licensing of facilities via Homeland Security
