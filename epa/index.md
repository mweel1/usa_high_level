# Environmental Protection Agency

The environmental protection agency would allow people to submit issues with various processes in the environment and provide the best solution to the problem.

The environmental protection agency would deploy this locally for various jurisdictions and allow various business to receive grants to transition to the solution.

For example, paper cups at a coffee shop would be replaced with locally produced mugs due to the waste in material and supply chain costs.

A grant would also be created for recycled water dish washing machines.
