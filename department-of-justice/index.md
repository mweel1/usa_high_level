# Department of Justice

The department of justice will run the court system for all civic related matters.

All federal, state and city laws will be added to the platform.

There is a board at the federal, state and city level for all civic laws.

Any downstream law that is voted on the public, must receive an approval from the jurisdiction above. For example, City laws need to be approved by the state board. State laws need to be approved by federal boards.

Any law can be proposed by citizens, where the citizens vote on it, and the board approves.

Any law can be revoked by citizens, where the citizens vote on it, and the board approves.

It will be the job of the boards in each jurisdiction to add their laws to the platform on startup.
