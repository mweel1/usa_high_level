# Government Communication Security

Our government will ensure security of its information with the following actions:

1. All jurisdictions must have their own internal intranet/social network for sensitive communications and internal workloads.

2. All press releases, media releases and all communications must originate from the governments website and available via an API for media outlets that must provide the source URL (per media licenses).
