# Express Visa

Express Visa would be a platform that would allows citizens traveling in and out of Mexico to receive a work visa with a bank account that would automatically deduct taxes.

The Express Visa would be integrated with our criminal system and Mexico's to increase disposition statuses.

The system would be integrated with the border patrol system.

Participants would be provided a .express-visa e-mail address along with a bank account. A flat tax rate would be applied to all receipts.

Any hiring of legal immigrants would have to pay through the bank account and verify e-mail address each day of work.

Each country would have a tax bracket.
