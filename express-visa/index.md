# Express Visa

Express Visa would be a platform that would allows citizens traveling in and out of the American Internet to receive a visa with a bank account that would automatically deduct taxes.

The Express Visa would be integrated with our criminal system.

Participants would be provided a .express-visa e-mail address along with a bank account. A flat tax rate would be applied to all receipts.

All payments would have to go through the e-visa bank account while using the American Internet.

Each country would have a tax bracket.
