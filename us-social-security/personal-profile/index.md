# Social Security Personal Profile

The social security personal profile will be the beginning of looking at a new way to issue social security cards and connect with the citizens in the internet age. It will be a new contract between the government and its citizens.

The social security office will store core data services that will serve the personal information of citizens from birth certificates, to death certificates and anything in-between.

We will start with just the social security card, drivers licenses, and payment cards. Level set what the market has today. We will then move to other government documents that are sent to citizens as the market and government adopts the technology.

## How it Works

### Personal Profile

#### New Citizens

Hospitals will have access to create a personal profile for newborn babies by licensed hospital management systems. They must upload the birth certificate once the profile is created.

#### Existing Citizens

When a user logs into an operating system for the first time, they will enter their social security number.

If they currently have a personal profile already setup the operating system will connect to it via e-mail and password where the contact information, government ID, and payment cards of the logged in user will be available for the operating system.

If they don't have a profile, the citizen:

- They are redirected to the social security office.
- A profile is created
- A QR Code is created and e-mailed to them, or they can print it.
- They must take the QR Code to their local post office.
- They will be instructed to bring all government documentation with them including:
  - Government-issued photo ID (e.g., driverâ€™s license, passport). At least one photo ID.
  - Birth certificate and/or Social Security card

Once the person goes to the facility, the facility will scan the QR Code and:

- Upload all documents to the personal profile including ID's, and certificates.
- Take 3 profile pictures
- Take a voice recording
- Finger printed

The office will also ensure all the organization around family members are set correctly based on the documentation.

It's highly recommend family members come into the office together. If a personal profile hasn't been setup for family members, they cannot be associated.

Once this is completed, they can go back to their computer. Enter their social security number, and login with their e-mail and password where the operating system is authenticated with the personal profile.

If the post office inspector is suspicious of the documentation, the availability of out of pocket questions will be available to use as a validation tool.

A Sworn affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury may be signed.

## Credit Cards

Today we are riddled with Google Pay and Apple Pay if we allow these technologies to be the only solution to processing cards we will continue to see monopolies in the market place.

The personal profile will have a direct connection to the federal reserve where:

1. A list of cards can be retrieved on setup based on drivers license.
2. A one time transaction ID can be requested from the federal reserve that is used to process the card through the processing networks. Optionally, a domain can be sent to ensure domains process the payments.

## Real Time E-Check System

E-check cards will be added by going oAuth with the federal reserve by approving the use of your social security number from your profile.

The oAuth handshake will create the ability for account/cards to automatically be added, removed and updated.

1. A list of back account/cards can be retrieved on setup based on drivers license.
2. A one time transaction ID can be requested from the federal reserve that is used to process the card through the processing networks. Optionally, a domain can be sent to ensure domains process the payments.

See E-Check System for more information.

### Processing Network Distinctions

When card Ids are passed to a payment API, they have a prefix defined by the federal reserve which will include:

-Credit Card
-ECheck

### Business Profile

Users can connect to business profiles of businesses by selecting them from their business license of the business they work at.

All business licenses must have:

- The employees personal profile
- Name of business and location
- Phone number

### Foreign Citizens

If a person is not an American Citizen they have to receive a VISA from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. In order to receive a VISA you must bring a letter that you are currently working from your employer, along with a phone number where they can be contacted.

Foreign citizens must go through the same process as citizens, but through the Immigration system instead of the social security.

Non citizen personal profiles will have a V prefix for example I-123-322-1222, where social security numbers will have a S Prefix. This will allow systems to use the correct DNS system when resolving personal profile domains.

The personal profile API surface, hosting, and all other details must be identical.

One example of an opportunity, is to give a grant and an e-visa to builders and dubai and start training, and building state of the art buildings in our towns and then have them return to their country.
