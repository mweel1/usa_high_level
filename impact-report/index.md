<Badge type="danger" text="United States to Private Market Place Impact Report" />

My priorities for this technology would be:

# Personal Profile

- [Personal Profile](/grants/personal-profile/) to start to capture all the value that the American Citizens deserve in the technology landscape.

## Impact

The introduction of robust authorization mechanisms will eliminate reliance on private marketplace SSO systems, such as “Login with Google” or “Login with Microsoft.” It will also simplify the cumbersome login processes.
A new three-tier passkey system provided by the Social Security Service will enable one-step authentication across devices, enhancing both security and user convenience.

### Facebook

Facebook will be impacted as your "photos" will now be stored in your personal profile, however there will be 1000s of social networks they can develop to bring networks together in an open way.

### Apple & Google

You will be impacted quite substantially with pulling out the wallet functionality. However, there were major use cases in using the publics keys in walled gardens that prohibit mobile phones, desktops and vehicle operating systems from communicating in a way that was civilized. A major duty of the FCC.

## Application Zones

- [Application Zones](/USA-Internet/application-zones/) to replace the QR Code as a national security threat and open an entire new application eco-system driving standards out of the FCC. This opens up an entirely new application eco-system that we are just starting to grasp.

#### Impact

Application Zones will enable localized network applications and services. For example, users in a specific town, state or country could simply press a button to select a Dining application in their area instead of global services like Yelp.

This shift will impact global business services such as Yelp, pushing them to adapt by integrating with local businesses and tailoring their applications to specific regions. Companies will likely pivot to selling their solutions to cities and regional app stores, altering their customer base and business models.

## Real-Time Electronic Check

- [Real Time Electronic Check](/e-check/) $0 cost transactions for Americans on a real-time network federal reserve network.

#### Impact

This initiative will disrupt traditional payment services, which have become commodities and often burdensome. Payment service providers are encouraged to innovate by developing applications within the new Application Zones ecosystem. By focusing on value-added services and generating revenue through application fees, these organizations can thrive in this evolving marketplace, and as a mater of fact lets prioritize these organizations in doing just that.
