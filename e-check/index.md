# Overview

Today is it extremely difficult to send money between two parties. Both parties must have the right application which is not only confusing but also very expensive.

ACH and other E-Check transactions take many days to process.

Furthermore, our current government has no safeguards to transaction business unless its with a 3rd party corporations. This is a security risk.

The United Stated E-check system provides the ability for both United States seller and buyers the ability to register their bank accounts and transfer money between each other natively in their operating systems.

## Process

The following process would be applied to create a debit profile at the Federal Reserve:

- Once the citizen authorized their operating system to operate with echeck.gov,the citizen would go to echeck.gov with their [gov.id](/government-os-services/id-gov/) and attach all their bank accounts.
- When a citizen was browsing a website, they would click a link on the browser that would initiate a list of bank accounts along with the amount of the transaction.
- The user would then select the bank account and the money would be transferred to the seller instantly.
- The e-check system would have tax flat rate that would be given to the IRS on behalf of transaction processors and distributed to state and local districts.

## Application Requirements

- A transaction list between buyer and seller must be provided for each account on the echeck.gov website.
- A link to transaction court to allow a seller and buyer to dispute a transaction where applicable laws would applied, for example:
  - A judgement to return money to buyer
  - A % of all future transactions will be provided to the winner of the case.
  - Loss of echeck access for a time period
- The following must be provided with each transaction:
  - A JSON file of the receipt
  - A copy of the the receipt
  - The domain in which the process took place

## Transaction Court

Much like domain court, transaction court would allow people to submit a claim that disputes the transaction. A list of previous judgments would be available. A jury selection would take place, and the jury would vote on the outcome which would include:

- A judgement to return money to buyer immediately (if available).
- A debit tax to paid the plaintiff.
- Loss of debit.gov access for a certain time period.
