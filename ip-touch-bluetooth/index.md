# IP over Touch Bluetooth

Touch bluetooth would provide a bi-directional tcp/ip stack between two devices when touched together.

For example, if you installed a thread based home automation system and purchased a home automation router you could touch the router with your device and provision in it.

It would also provide event links to native devices to call application or links.

A proxy would be available from the pairing device to access the internet.
