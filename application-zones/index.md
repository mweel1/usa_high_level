# Application Zones

Federal and state spheres are set by their jurisdiction via .gov email addresses.

Apps are approved as they are added by the jurisdiction.

In-order for an application to added to a business sphere a business license must be uploaded and validated. We will mandate all municipalities have an OAuth process to handshake between the application zones and business license to remove the need for human approval.

## Transportation Authority

The transportation authority in the district will also have spheres that can be updated in real time with a key for authorization. For example, an app to view your upcoming stops in a bus. Or an application to come up when you pay for a taxi cab.

Apple or Google cannot show these apps unless they are triggered by the provisioning process during os setup where a secure web socket receives all events from the sphere system, where they opt in on os startup.

Any transport organizations must provide either a valid business license or government Id.

## App Zone Directory

As part of the American DNS system applications can be queried based on their zone for operating system provides to provide the applications when their application zone button is pressed.

For example, I would type Las Vegas in the directory and all the external websites and applications associated with that zone would be available for people to use.

In-order to have a website or application registered in a sphere in must provide physical products and services in that sphere.

An American Internet App Store or Browser would like:

Concerts (Business Type) - [ Brooklyn, NY ] (App Zone)

News Networks
Shopping Networks
Retail Stores

## Internal Sphere Opportunity

There are many opportunities for a "business" sphere to have more context aware applications. For example in a hotel room, you might want to control lighting. This would be accomplished by access a hotel key with a specific room # where the application would know how to control the rooms devices.

## Operating System Control Events

Application Zones can trigger events in operating systems that for example could:

1. Turn off the ability to use a camera.
2. Redirect the contents of recordings to an API end point while in that zone.
3. Turn off a ring sound (say in a movie theater)

Anytime an application zone is defined it must be posted as such, along with zone restrictions which must be posted on their website. Furthermore, a QR code will be available to view these restrictions outside of the facility.

## History

A history of applications will be available in their personal profile that were used where they can be used out of context of the application zone.
