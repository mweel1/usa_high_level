# Personal Licensing Agency

Personal licenses are issued to people based on the requirements of the various licensees available. Which might include certificates, degrees and other forms of requirements. These licenses are stored in the personal licensing agency’s system for verification and handles the integration into the personal profile.

[Licensed software applications]() require a valid license, certificates to grant access to the system via the personal profile certificates and/or licenses.

For example, a bartender license might be needed to log in to systems that manage bartender services. The personal licensing agency maintains a list of software applications and their license requirements, which are implemented in the marketplace.

License verification are checked and enforced through the FBI by walking around and testing log-ins of employees.

Applications must not only check a user’s license and/or certificate in their profile but also confirm its validity with the personal licensing agency via the ID.
