# Financial Laws and Prosecution

# Core Financial Transaction Laws

1. Contract Law

   - Governs agreements, including loan agreements, and work with NTIS on standards.

   - If a borrower fails to repay a loan, they are in breach of contract, which allows the lender to sue for damages or repayment.

2. Banking Regulations

   - Regulate how financial institutions issue loans, charge interest, and handle defaults.

   - In the U.S., examples include the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Dodd-Frank Act.

3. Consumer Credit Protection Laws

   - Designed to protect borrowers from unfair lending practices.
   - Example: Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) regulates how lenders can pursue unpaid debts.

4. Usury Laws

   - Set maximum interest rates lenders can charge, or ensure fair market practices are put into place with banks.

   - If a loan exceeds these rates, it may be unenforceable.

5. Collateral and Secured Transactions Law

   - Under laws like Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in the U.S., if a borrower defaults on a secured loan, the lender can repossess the collateral.

6. Bankruptcy Law

   - Governs how debts are handled when the borrower is insolvent.
   - Includes Chapter 7 (liquidation), Chapter 11 (reorganization), and Chapter 13 (repayment plan) in the U.S.

7. Civil Procedure Law

   - Provides the framework for how a lender can sue a borrower and obtain a judgment in civil court.

8. Judgment Enforcement Law

   - Once a judgment is issued, laws govern how a lender can collect (e.g., garnish wages, levy bank accounts, or place liens on property).

9. Fraud and Misrepresentation Laws

   - If a borrower lies on a loan application, criminal or civil fraud charges may apply.
