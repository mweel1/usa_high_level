# Consumer Protection Agency

## Background

When my wife and I go out to dinner many times I get frustrated for various reasons why a credit card receipt is designed the way it is. It’s very small, hard to read, some have an option for a tip box, some don’t. It’s time consuming and I spend more time than I want to paying for my meal.

Other times I might be on the street, and cannot see a car coming because of some overgrown trees.

To resolve this issue where would you as a citizen go for something like this? Who would you talk to?

## Overview

The consumer protection agency would allow the public to submit ideas to improve consumer wellbeing in the marketplace where it would be voted on by other consumers and then assigned to the correct government agency where projects would be created, receive input from the public, and then be assigned to the correct government agencies who would bring them to fruition by passing laws and managing work with the public market.
