# Preface

The war between the mobile companies and in-car informatics systems has left the user of vehicles confused on how to operate their vehicle, even worse while they are driving increasing the chances for accidents.

# Singe Vehicle Operating Systems

The only requirement for the market place is that one operating system must be present. Otherwise car manufacturers can participate in the following:

- A business profile URL can be added to the operating system so the vehicle can support business functions.
- The federal government will be provide a OS boot loader to allow for multiple operating choices in vehicles, around with an open market place to purchase these operating systems and run them.
- The federal government will take control of the standards between the vehicle and and operating systems that will be available to the market. Currently these are being guarded by Apple and Google.
- Consumers will have a right to choose their operating system at time of purchasing a vehicle, or any time after they purchase a vehicle.
- All vehicles operating systems will have to choose from a configuration of (x) vehicle display configurations.
- All vehicles must provide a single operating system. If Apple, Google and others want to play in the market they must provide an in-car operating system, not requiring a user to have a phone.
- All operating systems must operate on any screen configuration so it can be transferable between vehicles.
- All vehicle operating systems must be approved by the NHTSA before being released based on their requirements using AI and manual procedures.
- Authorization happens with a camera that must be installed on all vehicles, or code entry to bind a personal profile to the vehicle. For example, a camera would identify a user and receive the oAuth key's from their personal profile where it would be cached locally.
- Provide AI "glitches" from driver assisted technologies to improve roadway design.
- Provide road condition information for example a pot hole that jolts the vehicle where it can be distributed to municipalities for repair.
- Provide the location to the Highway Patrol of an intoxicated driver based on vehicle inputs (breaking, swerving,etc).
- Provide location to the highway patrol if items are in the road and need be removed.
- Vehicles could receive emergency alerts where license plates would be downloaded to the car. The car would have an on-board OCR system and when finding a plate on the list would send the location to the Highway Patrol via [federal dispatch system](/federal-emergency-dispatch/).
- Vehicle cameras would watch other cars for erratic driving behavior and provide it to the Highway Patrol via [federal dispatch system](/federal-emergency-dispatch/).
- All vehicles will have a 100 meter RF network that will turn down card radio with a notification an emergency vehicle is the area. using FCC FREQ : xxxxxx, that will be swapped with operating system daily as frequencies permit.

- [Federal Roadway Signs Application](/federal-roadway-signs) will be available for all vehicles to receive street sign information.
