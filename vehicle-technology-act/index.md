# Preface

The war between the mobile companies and in-car informatics systems has left the user of vehicles confused on how to operate their vehicle, even worse while they are driving increasing the chances for accidents.

# Standard Display Interfaces

- Consumers have a right to choose their operating system at time of purchasing a vehicle.
- All vehicles will have to choose from a configuration of (x) vehicle display configurations.
- All vehicles must provide a single operating system. If Apple, Google and others want to play in the market they must provide an in-car operating system, not requiring a user to have a phone.
- All operating systems must operate on any screen configuration so it can be transferable between vehicles.
- All vehicle operating systems must be approved by the NHTSA before being released based on their requirements.
- Authwntication happens with a camera that must be installed on all vehicles, or code entry.
