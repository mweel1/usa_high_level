# Preface

The war between the mobile companies and in-car informatics systems has left the user of vehicles confused on how to operate their vehicle, even worse while they are driving increasing the chances for accidents.

# Singe Vehicle Operating Systems

The only requirement for the market place is that one operating system must be present. Otherwise car manufacturers can participate in the following:

- The federal government will be provide a OS boot loader to allow for multiple operating choices in vehicles, around with an open market place to purchase these operating systems.
- Using AI operating systems will be evaluated for their safety standards.
- The federal government will take control of the standards between the vehicle and and operating systems that will be available to the market.
- Consumers will have a right to choose their operating system at time of purchasing a vehicle, or any time after they purchase a vehicle.
- All vehicles operating systems will have to choose from a configuration of (x) vehicle display configurations.
- All vehicles must provide a single operating system. If Apple, Google and others want to play in the market they must provide an in-car operating system, not requiring a user to have a phone.
- All operating systems must operate on any screen configuration so it can be transferable between vehicles.
- All vehicle operating systems must be approved by the NHTSA before being released based on their requirements.
- Authorization happens with a camera that must be installed on all vehicles, or code entry to bind a personal profile to the vehicle. For example, a camera would identify a user and receive the key from their personal profile where it would be cached locally.
- Operating system will also be required to :
- Provide location information to the NHTSA where jurisdiction can query geo fences to get information on car accidents, including driver testimonials or onboard video.
- Provide AI bugs from driver assisted technologies to improve roadway design
- Provide road condition information for example a pot hole that jolts the vehicle where it can be distributed to municipalities for repair.
- Receive "hot" plates where video systems could provide locations of vehicles when scene by cameras
- Provide the location to the Highway Patrol of an intoxicated driver based on vehicle inputs (breaking, swerving,etc)
- Vehicles could receive emergency alerts where license plates would be downloaded to the car. The car would have an on-board OCR system and when finding a plate on the list would send the location to the Highway Patrol via [federal dispatch system](/federal-emergency-dispatch/).
- Vehicle cameras would watch other cars for erratic driving behavior and provide it to the Highway Patrol via [federal dispatch system](/federal-emergency-dispatch/).
- All vehicles will have a 100 meter RF network that will turn down card radios using FCC FREQ : xxxxxx, that will be swapped with operating system daily as frequency permit.
