# Children Electronic Device Protection Services

## Overview

Each [device operating system](/government-os-services/) will have a connection to the children electronic device service.

When a phone is delivered on-line, or in person the first thing that must be defined is if the device is for an adult or child. If it is a an adult they must be asked if they know how to control their child's devices using the Children Electronic Device Protection application on the device. The application would work bi-directionally. So all devices must provide the app and the functionality.

If it is a children device, a startup QR code comes up where they must go to a person over the age of 18 and scan the code where that will bind access between the adult and child devices.

Once the devices are linked the parent would have access to the following functionality:

1. The ability to snap a screen-shot of the devices screen at any-time.
2. Complete replication of screen contents, audio/video to linked device.
3. Simple setting of operating hours
4. Advanced, scheduling of screen-time by categories and domains.

[Public service announcement](/public-service-announcements/) will be created about teaching children about the dangers of meeting people on-line.
