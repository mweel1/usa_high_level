# Children Electronic Device Protection Services

## Overview

Each [device operating system](/government-os-services/) will have a connection to the children electronic device service.

When a device logs into the personal server, if the profile is for a child then the system will request parents and guardians from your profile.

This will send a request to the personal profile of the adult where a token will provide the link between the child and the parent/guardian where the parent will have access to via the child electronic device protection service to:

1. The ability to snap a screen-shot of the devices screen at any-time.
2. Complete replication of screen contents, audio/video to linked device.
3. Simple setting of operating hours
4. Advanced, scheduling of screen-time by categories and domains.

## Default Settings

The federal government will create default settings for parents which can be changed.
