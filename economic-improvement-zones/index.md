# Economic Improvement Zones

Economic zones would most likely be city wide, maybe county, or just a derived perimeter based on geography.

The goal of the economic zone would bring life back into areas that have deteriorated.

The goal of the economic zone would be to:

1. Train individuals on govt functions (Street Maintenance, Water, etc.) via trade schools.
2. Provide grant for trade schools to allow individuals to learn various business functions.
3. Provide loans at various rates depending on the market needs

### Vertical Govt' Organizations

[Vertical govt organizations](/vertical-gov/) must have training programs that they can provide to citizens to bring their governance model up.

## Rates

Rates could be controlled in the following categories at local banks:

Business Loans/Capital
Business Vehicle Loans
Personal Vehicle
Housing
Commercial Real-estate
Machinery
Business Loans

Business Loans could reduce rates of areas of certain type of businesses that were missing in the market place. This would be derived from vendors requesting trading partners. You could also look to see what products are traveling to far and could be made more localized.

### Business Vehicle Loans

You would have to look at various aspects of the business climate locally and set rates accordingly. If shipping times were being delayed you could reduce rates for transport vehicles. If construction companies working on various services were coming far away you could reduce rates for those vehicles.

### Machinery

Machinery would be applied the same as business loans.

### Housing

If inventory was high in certain markets you could reduce interest rates, you could even go negative to allow for people to have capital improvements in areas that’s have been overrun with crime, drugs and violence.

### Commercial Real-estate

I could imagine as we split warehousing and transportation supply chains that you could stimulate the market with lower rates.

### Trade Schools

I could imagine creating grants for trade schools, pre capital — and cut off social services.

### Economic Zone Closures

For economic zones that don't participate in education for the upcoming market opportunities will have to migrate to other cities, with a check for the transition. If they don't participate in that economy they will be moved to forced labor situations -- where housing and labor is defined
