## Overview

When a person gets denied for using counterfeit money at a business, they would have the right to get it exchanged for real money by providing a government id that is not currently blacklisted from returning to much currency in the past, if they weren't already in jail.

The counterfeit money would be sent to the FBI where it would be analyzed using imaging AI based on its physicality and location for exchange.
