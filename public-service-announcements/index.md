# Public Service Announcement Services

A public service announcement service would be available for all media platforms and serve public service announcements.

This would include photo and text based (for platforms like Twitter), and video. Each major media platform would be required to show these announcements based on the % of impressions.

The amount of impressions would be determined by the board.
