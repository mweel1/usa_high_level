# Public Service Announcement Services

A public service announcement service would be available for all media platforms that would serve public service announcements.

This would include media formats such as:

- Social Media Posts
- Memes
- Videos for various formats (TikTok, TV)

The amount of impressions required per media view would be determined by the board.

An API would be provided to log when an media business provided the announcement.
