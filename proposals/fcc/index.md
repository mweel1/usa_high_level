1.  General Information
    • What type of contract are you pursuing (e.g., IT services, consulting, telecommunications infrastructure)?

    Information Technology

    • Are you targeting a prime contract (direct with FCC) or a subcontract (partnering with an existing contractor)?

    Direct Contact

    • Do you have any small business certifications (8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB)?

    I only use business specific certificates through a USA domain system.

2.  Scope of Work (SOW)
    • What services or products will you provide to the FCC?

    We would like the market to have the ability to map out their domain zones with their cell phone, that will be approved by the FCC by evaluating various documentation to prove ownership of the zone.

    When these zones are created, people can deploy applications to them.

    This allows the market place to press a button in a specific place and get applications deployed to them.

    To be blunt, its a QR Code on steroids.

    • Are there specific FCC regulations, technologies, or industry standards involved?

    It's my hope after we develop this it will be hosted and managed by the FCC.

    • Will your work require specialized clearances, security protocols, or compliance requirements?

    No, we will just develop technology, send it to you, your security teams review, and you deploy and host.

3.  Technical and Compliance Requirements

    • What technical skills, qualifications, or certifications are required?

    The FCC will need to bring on a new role to approve the documents in the domain zones that doesn't currently exist today.

    • Are there cybersecurity or FedRAMP compliance needs?

    Please provide us all security requirements for :

         - Authentication
         - Sensitive data at rest
         - Key Management

    We will also comply to any other security requirements.

    • Does the FCC require any reporting standards or KPIs for performance tracking?

    Yes, the FCC will provide an API to allow the market place to query the zones where applications would be deployed.

4.  Delivery & Timeline

    • What is the estimated timeline for completing the work?

    3-6 Months.

    • Are there milestones or phased deliverables?

    Yes.

    1. First, we will work on modeling the zones with a cell phone, and submitting and approving documents.
    2. Second, customers will put their applications into the zones.
    3. Third, we will allow the handset companies to build their interfaces.
    4. Fourth, We will go to market.

    • What dependencies could impact your ability to deliver?

    The only dependency is the handset carries not wanting an "application store" in this capacity. If this was the case, I will provide another proposal for an operating system company, where a set of standards would be integrated with a Personal Profile and allow for many operating systems in the market place.

5.  Budget & Pricing Structure

    • What pricing model are you considering (fixed-price, time & materials, cost-plus)?

    Please send 1 Million at a time, and we will demo our progress.

    • Do you need to factor in GSA rates or competitive federal pricing?

    I respect our relationship where if I provide the idea, and deliver you continue to single source with me please.

    • Are there any subcontractor costs or material expenses?

    No, we will have a direct workforce.

6.  Key Stakeholders & Communication
    • Who are the decision-makers and FCC contacts for this contract?

    Anyone looking to provide technology standards to the market place for better interoperability.

    • How will progress be reported (weekly, monthly updates)?

    We will have weekly standup meetings.

    • Will there be onsite requirements or remote work?

    Remote work will be fine.

7.  Risks & Mitigation
    • What are the main risks (regulatory changes, delays, technology challenges)?

    The biggest risk, was multi-level sphere's in businesses but there is technology to allow us model these zones in the 3 dimensions.

    • How will you address compliance issues or unexpected challenges?

    Discuss them.

    • Do you have contingency plans for staff, resources, or supply chain risks?

    No, I will be working closely with a team of developers.
