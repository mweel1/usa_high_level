# Cooperative Business Model

A Cooperative will be a new type of business established at the state level, designed to ensure fair financial distribution among its members.

Once we start thinking about businesses as mono-lithic applications along with their physical location we can start to think about integrated financial models with trading partners that will enable this clean type of business.

This model enforces an integrated financial framework, where cash distributions follow a simple percentage-based payout system. After covering income, debt obligations, and state and federal taxes, surplus funds are allocated based on a predefined savings threshold.

For example, if the cooperative sets a 20% cash reserve requirement, payouts to members occur only after reserves reach this level. This ensures financial stability while allowing equitable profit sharing.
