# Sphere Events

Federal and state spheres are set by their jurisdiction via .gov email addresses.

Apps are approved as they are added by the jurisdiction.

Special Adventure District will have office that approves spheres with a .gov email addresses will be integrated permitting office where a spec will be defined in the g2g standards for other districts.

Other districts that donâ€™t support integrated business licensing will have to manually review business licenses before they approve businesses spheres and apps and keep up to date on them.

The transportation authority in the district will also have spheres that can be updated in real time with a key.

Apple or Google cannot show these apps unless they are triggered by the provisioning process during os setup where a secure web socket receives all events from the sphere system, where they opt in on os startup.

A history of applications by will be available where they can be used out of context.

For spheres where tight accuracy is needed an SSID registry will be created where applications and links can be associated to a network where they are triggeres on connection.
