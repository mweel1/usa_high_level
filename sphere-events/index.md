# Sphere Events

Federal, State, City, Home owners and Businesses would be able to geo-fence their areas which would event domain links, and/or native os-applications when a request was made by the [government OS service](/government-os-services/) for their current location.

Applications can be ordered in the sphere with categories based on the business type.

Imagine walking into a restaurant with you mobile device and press the sphere button on your mobile device where your menu would be provided, and other local services for the facility.

Imagine going to a mountain bike park and receiving passes along with rules and regulations.

Imagine driving into a city and your [car os](/vehicle-technology-act/) auto loads applications for city services of that specific city.

These events would be provided via the [government-os](/government-os-services/) and the host operating system must run the link in a browser, or open the application.
