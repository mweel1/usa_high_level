# Sphere Events

Federal and state spheres are set by their jurisdiction via .gov email addresses.

Apps are approved as they are added by the jurisdiction.

In-order for an application to added to a business sphere a business license must be uploaded and validated.

## Transportation Authority

The transportation authority in the district will also have spheres that can be updated in real time with a key for authorization. For example, an app to view your upcoming stops in a bus. Or an application to come up when you pay for a taxi cab.

Apple or Google cannot show these apps unless they are triggered by the provisioning process during os setup where a secure web socket receives all events from the sphere system, where they opt in on os startup.

Any transport organizations must provide either a valid business license or government Id.

## Sphere Directory

A directory of spheres will be available in global search directory where people can navigate websites that have been assigned to that that sphere.

For example, I would type Las Vegas in the directory and all the external websites and applications associated with that sphere would be available for people to use.

In-order to have a website or application registered in a sphere in must provide physical products and services in that sphere.

## History

A history of applications will be available where they can be used out of context of the sphere.
