# Licensing Agency

The licensing agency would be developed for the Santiago internet, and have rules for each type of business in Santigao.

The licensing agency would have a directory of education companies that would provide training and certification, where when completed a license ID would be provided.

Certain licenses would need to be kept up to date based on the rules of the licensing type.

The license ID would be public and as a URL, or QR Code for verification.

An email would be issued for each license where it would need to be used to login to provide various services for that license.

For example, a .bartender e-mail would be provided and would be used to logged in whenever serving drinks.

These could be revoked by the licensing agency if the person violated licenses.
