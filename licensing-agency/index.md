# Licensing Agency

The licensing agency would be developed for the American internet, and have rules for each type of business in Silverado.

The licensing agency would have a directory of education companies that would provide training and certification, where when completed a license ID would be provided.

Certain licenses would need to be kept up to date based on the rules of the licensing type.
