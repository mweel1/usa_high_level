# Court System

A federally deployed court system for various jurisdictions would allow the procurement of court cases. The federally deployed court system would allow various jurisdictions to register with their .gov e-mail address and receive access to their jurisdiction to manage it.

They would be allowed to licensed judges into the system, which would receive a callback from the licensing system.

The court system would allow for people to:

- Select a case type.
- Provide evidence of the case from both parties within 30 days.

Once all evidence is collected the jury would have 30 more days to request more information from the plaintiff and defendant in regards to evidence.

Judges will be licensed in each platform and advise court cases in the jurisdictions portal.

The jury would then deliberate the case and make a decision.

If the case was to difficult for the jury, they could request expert advise from industry experts via a bidding process. Expert witnesses would be on the system for various subject matters and would be bided out for their services.
