# E-Census

The goal of the e-census system would be to query the public for key information.

The census would send e-mail's via a .gov e-mail address from various jurisdictions.

The census system will be a unified platform that would allow various jurisdictions to query their constituents.

The resulting data will be available in raw format after it has been requested.

The resulting data will be available to public anonymously.
