# E-Census

The goal of the e-census system would be to query the public for key information using their gov't Id much like it does today.

The census would provide an API that would accept a gov't id from the operating system and provide a list of all open surveys for that citizen has yet to complete.

In some cases the census could provide money to via [e-check](/e-check/) for completing surveys.
