# E-Census

The goal of the e-census system would be to query the public for key information.

The census would provide an API that would accept a gov't id from the operating system and provide a list of all open surveys for that citizen has yet to complete.

The census system will be a unified platform that would allow various jurisdictions to query their constituents.
