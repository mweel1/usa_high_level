# Business Licensing

You would go to the a federal deployed system for a business license locally at the FCC.

You will get a business license for a business with an API that is associated to it from a federal registry if you choose.

You must setup a domain zone as part of the process for its location, and define it's applications from a store of applications for that business.

The business license must also follow all local, state and federal laws.
