# Pharmaceutical Reduction Organization

A pill to cross the ocean has significant costs, if the pill were made here by licensed manufacturers on a retail network the cost would be much lower.

I suggest CVS and Walgreens become manufacturer and responsible for bringing this technology to United States with approved UL machines and implement it and we build small business pharmacy networks again.

.pharmacy containers would be provided by UOH and the B2B specification would be available at the chamber of commerce.
