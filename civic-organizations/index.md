# Technology Plan: Civic Organizations

## 1. Executive Summary

The Vertical Government Platform is designed to foster coordinated governance across federal, state, and city levels. The platform ensures transparency, accountability, and seamless interaction between jurisdictions, agencies, and citizens. It supports the management of finances, legal processes, and licensing across different layers of government.

## Advantages of Vertical Governance

1. Clear Lines of Authority and Responsibility
   • In vertical governance, each level (federal, state, city) knows its scope and duties.
   • Easier to assign accountability if something goes wrong.

2. Streamlined Decision-Making
   • Decisions can flow downward or upward through a clear chain.
   • Less time wasted on consensus-building between peers (like in horizontal setups).

3. Better Coordination Across Jurisdictions
   • Federal, state, and city governments stay aligned on priorities.
   • Prevents duplication of programs or conflicting policies across different areas.

4. Efficient Resource Allocation
   • Resources (money, personnel, tech) can be distributed strategically across levels.
   • Easier to prioritize funding where it’s most needed.

5. Unified Standards and Systems
   • Legal processes, finance systems, and licensing can be standardized vertically.
   • Citizens and businesses deal with consistent rules, making compliance simpler.

6. Greater Transparency
   • Centralized platforms allow for better tracking of how decisions are made and funds are spent across levels.
   • Reduces the risk of corruption or inefficiency hidden in the cracks.

7. Enhanced Public Services
   • Seamless interaction between agencies improves services like permits, grants, and dispute resolution.
   • Citizens don’t get “bounced around” between departments or jurisdictions.

8. Stronger Crisis Response
   • In emergencies (like pandemics, natural disasters), a vertical structure can mobilize coordinated responses quickly.
   • Easier to set command chains and allocate responsibilities.

9. Policy Consistency
   • Vertical systems help keep national goals synchronized with local implementation.
   • Avoids the “patchwork” effect of wildly different local policies that horizontal systems sometimes create.

10. Supports Long-Term Planning
    • Multi-level planning becomes possible — federal, state, and local strategies can build on each other over years.
    • Encourages sustainable, coherent growth rather than piecemeal efforts.
11. Training
    - As new economic zones, or cities are brought on-line having a vertical integrated training programs coupled with grant money is a powerful tool.

## Disadvantages of Horizontal Governance (Governor, Congress, Senators)

1. Fragmentation of Authority
   • Power is spread widely and often unevenly across many actors.
   • Leads to conflicts between branches, agencies, or states and departments.
   • Extremely difficult to know who is responsible for decisions or failures.

2. Gridlock and Inaction
   • Different parties, states, or chambers (House vs. Senate) can block each other.
   • Compromise is difficult, so major policies stall for years.

3. Inconsistent Policies Across Jurisdictions
   • States and cities often have vastly different laws on key issues (education, healthcare, business).
   • Creates confusion and inefficiencies for citizens and businesses operating in multiple areas.

4. Duplication of Efforts
   • Multiple states, cities, or agencies create their own systems, wasting resources.
   • No shared infrastructure for things like licensing, finance management, or legal processes.

5. Competition Over Cooperation
   • States and political actors prioritize their own interests over national or collective goals.
   • “Race to the bottom” scenarios happen (e.g., tax breaks to lure businesses).

6. Poor Crisis Response
   • In emergencies, coordination is chaotic (states fighting over PPE during COVID, for example).
   • No single chain of command to quickly organize and allocate resources.

7. Uneven Quality of Services
   • Horizontal governance leads to wide gaps in education quality, healthcare access, infrastructure investment, etc.
   • Where you live often determines how well you are served.

8. Opaque Accountability
   • Blame-shifting is easy: governors blame Congress
   • Citizens struggle to know who to hold responsible.

9. Short-Term Thinking
   • Horizontal setups are often dominated by electoral cycles and political point-scoring over long periods of time.
   • Long-term planning (like infrastructure or climate policy) is sacrificed for short-term wins.

10. Excessive Partisanship
    • Divided control encourages fighting between branches or parties instead of solving problems.
    • Compromise becomes politically risky rather than rewarded.

# Risk Analysis of Vertical Governance

1. Risk of Over centralization

   • Too much power can get concentrated at the top (federal level). Local and state needs may be ignored in favor of national priorities. Reduced Local Flexibility.

   - Using a grant system, we can ensure various state and cities get the funding they need to make the decisions. Government Accountability Office will have to watch the funding levels across jurisdictions and make recommendations to the public if there are in-consistences or issues arising.

2. Potential for Bureaucratic Bloat
   • Managing a tightly connected multi-level system can create layers of administrative overhead.

   - This is the objective of the platform.

3. Innovation Stifling

   • States and cities often serve as “laboratories of democracy” — trying new policies that others can learn from.

   • Vertical systems can discourage experimentation by enforcing uniform standards too early.

   - The platform will give local, state flexibility while having federal over-site to ensure they don't turn into "laboratories".

4. Accountability Confusion (in a Different Way)

   • Citizens may not know whether to blame federal, state, or city levels if outcomes are poor.

   • Shared responsibility can sometimes lead to shared excuses.

   It will be clear where the voting takes place and what jurisdictions and government agency.

5. Political Power Struggles

   • States and cities might resist federal mandates, leading to hidden battles and passive resistance.

   • Legal challenges (lawsuits between states and federal government) can increase.

   - People will be voting on these issues, I don't believe the state or federal government could override the votes of its citizens.

## 2. Business Requirements

The platform must meet the following business objectives:

### 2.1 Finance Management

- Enable acceptance of ACH payments from the Federal Reserve to top-level designated government agencies based on:
- Budget allocations from the federal and all downstream jurisdictions
- Budget legislative/cycle

- Support the allocation of funds across federal, state, and city jurisdictions based on budgetary requirements with integrated approval workflows for transferring money.

  - The management will have a budget section that will be solidified, or in-progress for the following cycle.

  - The budget must be voted on by the board every cycle at the top level government agency, so downstream agencies match the budget cycles.

- Provide comprehensive budget management tools for agencies across all jurisdictional levels.

### 2.2 Legislative Management

- Enable citizens to propose new laws or policy changes within their jurisdiction and government agency.

- Allow board members and officials within jurisdictions and agencies to propose, amend, or veto laws.

- Allow board members to transfer proposed laws between jurisdictions based on relevance or escalation needs.

- Allow the citizens to vote on a new board/budget cycle.

- Any higher jurisdictions hire can override legislative decisions of lower organizations.

- Other horizontal government organizations can weigh in on legislative decisions. For example the EPA, might weigh in if FEMA is building a new fleet of fire trucks. No other government agency organization can override another one except for the President.

### 2.3 Licensing and Certification

- Support the issuance of licenses to individual profiles based on successful education, testing, and certification through approved organizations.

- Ensure licensing workflows are jurisdiction-specific and integrate with external educational and certifying organizations.

### 2.4 Cross Organizational Comparison

- Allow the evaluation of cross organization comparisons between organizations.
