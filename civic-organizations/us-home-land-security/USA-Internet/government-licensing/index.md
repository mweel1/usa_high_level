# Government Licensing

All .gov web applications, and children container applications that are part of a .gov registry must have a certificate in their personal profile for the domain of either the top level .gov domain, or downstream jurisdiction domains to login.

- Any government agent must be related to one or many domains, except the President.

- All applications must check with the homeland security with the certificate Id on login.

- Anytime an existing certificate changes, the associated domains will receive a notification to retrieve the certificate details.

- All employees of the government would need a license on ethics, and duties related to their position, and to ensure their duty lies with the United States of America and no other outside interests.

- HHS will issue a government license with terms, and add users to the homeland security social network.

- All education sites for these roles must be .government-education and approved by the president and placed in the Homeland Security Registry. Each .government-education container must provide training for a specific role.
