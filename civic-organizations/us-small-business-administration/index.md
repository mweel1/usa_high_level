# US Small Business Administration

The Small Business Administration would determine the business license requirements for all parcels in the country.

Grants would be provided to each jurisdiction to do physical inspections and manage their business license .business-inspection containers.

The data would be replicated to the SBA for analysis provided via a G2G specification.

# .business-inspection

The small business business license business container at various jurisdictions will allow to:

- Approve a license for a certain business type
- Ensure the business is setup correctly at the FCC with a correct domain zone profile and b2b specification from the commerce department.
- Each time a business permit is re-associated with a domain zone its cleared.

Different licenses would be needed based on the b2b specification type to approve the business starting up, or on an on-going basis where it would be reviewed based on its expiration date.

Local FBI field offices would visit all the businesses in their field to make sure the licenses in the domain zone are operating as they should.

    - Business Name
