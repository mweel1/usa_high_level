# Purchasing a Phone

I would goto the Apple Store and pay for my phone.

They would ask for mt personal profile during the payment process, they would ask if would like access to any personal profile devices.

I would say yes, and give them the personal profile of my child. If my child has a phone available they would have to ack.

If my child didn't have a phone, and they were listed as a guardian I could approve that automatically.
