# Public Service Announcement Services

A Public Service Announcement (PSA) service will be made available across all media platforms to disseminate important messages for the public good.

Supported media formats include:

- Social media posts
- Memes and digital graphics
- Short- and long-form videos (e.g., TikTok, YouTube, television, streaming platforms)
- Audio segments (e.g., radio, podcasts)
- Static placements (e.g., billboards, transit signage)

The required number of impressions or views per media type will be determined by the governing board, and must be implemented by media outlets.

An API will be provided to allow media organizations to log, verify, and report PSA placements in real time.

Examples of PSA topics include:

    •	Vaccination campaigns
    •	E-bike safety and local laws
    •	Road safety and traffic regulations
    •	Responsible cell phone use in public
    •	Emergency preparedness (earthquakes, floods, fires)
    •	Mental health awareness
    •	Public transit etiquette
    •	Anti-smoking and vaping campaigns
    •	Substance abuse prevention
    •	Cyberbullying and online safety
    •	Water and energy conservation
    •	Civic participation (voting, census, town halls)
    •	Environmental protection (recycling, pollution awareness)

This service ensures broad and consistent outreach on key public issues, leveraging modern media channels to maximize impact.
