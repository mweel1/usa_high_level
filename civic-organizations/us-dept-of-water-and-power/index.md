# US Department of Power and Water

The US Power and Water would manage many districts across jurisdictions which include funding, licensing and supply procurement.

Since resources are limited, its important to remember that they should not be free and pricing should be regulated based on income capabilities of districts, and resource constraints. Each "retail" district would be responsible for managing this along with the Department of Power and Water.

# Technology Development
