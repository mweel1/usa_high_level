# US Department of Power and Water

The US Power and Water would manage many districts across jurisdictions which include funding, licensing and supply procurement.

Since resources are limited, its important to remember that they should not be free and pricing should be regulated based on income capabilities of districts, and resource constraints. Each "retail" district would be responsible for managing this along with the Department of Power and Water.

# Jurisdictions

The department of power and water would have a top-level organization, along with the sub-jurisdictions, and actual jurisdictions.

Sub-Jurisdictions are important so equipment, technology and best practices can be managed in various groups. A single top-level organization and a district would loose make that role extremely difficult.

# Financial and Monitoring Objectives

Any pipe-line that enters and leaves a district, must have the capabilities to monitor and pay the source(s) for the resource from the provider.

The Department of Power and Water jurisdictions would be responsible for all billing, monitoring and maintenance of pipelines.

The department of power and water would ensure the market works smoothly, and nobody is gouging.

All districts would have to report their utility type, price, source for resources to the DOE.

Monetary requirements are required to monitor costs based on income, ensure costs for over-use. Furthermore, it helps reduce inflation.
