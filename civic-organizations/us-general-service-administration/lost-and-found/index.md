# Lost and Found

Lost and Found would be a federal government application zone application available for any jurisdiction that wanted to manage it.

It would include a .lost-and-found container server application based on a G2C standard, and a web base domain zone app that can be connected to it.

When finding an item the user would:

- Post a picture of the item and the time
- Select a safe place to drop off the item, or have it transported by a carrier.

The person that lost it would:

- Provide an Identification.
- Geo-fence the area they lost the item, and the time of day range.
- Go pick up the item.
