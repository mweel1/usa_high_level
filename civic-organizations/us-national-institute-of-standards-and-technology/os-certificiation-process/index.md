# NTIS Operating System Testing and Certification

## Organizational Presence

The following organizations will have a formal presence and/or contact at the National Technology Integration System (NTIS), as will other large market operating system manufacturers.

• Apple
• Google
• Microsoft
• Social Security Administration (to support development of the Personal Profile system)

## Comprehensive Testing

NTIS will conduct comprehensive testing across all operating systems. These tests will simulate full interaction with government functions to ensure compatibility, performance, and security.

### Mobile and Desktop Platform Standards

    - NTIS will provide deployment servers integrated with the USA Internet DNS system.

    - Each software release must include a cryptographic hash that is visible on the about section of all operating systems.

    - All operating systems must be tested for roll-back reliability.

## Certification Requirements for Desktop and Mobile OS

Before deployment in the marketplace, all operating systems must pass certification ensuring the following:

    - Government Branding Control: Devices may not display government seals unless retrieved through a verified personal profile.
    - Communication Standards: Government emails must be clearly identified and displayed accurately in client software.
    - Emergency Messaging: Emergency communication messages must be correctly formatted and prominently displayed from the Emergency via the FCC.  The FCC must have test capabilities in their system to test these.
    - National Security Compatibility: All required NSA functions must operate reliably.
    - Key Management: Key storage must be securely managed through the personal profile and emergency notification system.
    - Application Zone Controls: Application zone buttons must function correctly, ensuring isolation and control of app behaviors.
    - Local Dispatch: Local emergency dispatch capabilities must operate as intended.
    Child Protection: Devices must include working child protection and parental control features.
    Browser Integrity: Browsers must validate that the client originated from the correct server to prevent spoofing, and provide government seal border around government e-mails and websites who have a government certificate issued by Homeland Security.

## AI Assistance and Privacy Legislation

A proposed law to be voted on at the NTIS will determine if AI assistants are permitted to listen-in for signs of abuse in homes. The law would offer the following policy options:

    1. Yes, Always – AI systems must always monitor for abuse.
    2. Yes, When Opted-In – AI systems may monitor only with user consent.
    3. Never – AI systems are not permitted to monitor for abuse under any circumstances.

Even though we might assume the answer to be #2, it's good to public input because to ensure they are part of the process.
