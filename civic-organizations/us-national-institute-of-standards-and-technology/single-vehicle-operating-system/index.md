# Preface

The war between the mobile companies and in-car informatics systems has left the user of vehicles confused on how to operate their vehicle, even worse while they are driving increasing the chances for accidents.

# Singe Vehicle Operating Systems

The only requirement for the market place is that one operating system must be present. Otherwise car manufacturers can participate in the following:

- A business profile URL can be added to the operating system so the vehicle can support business functions.

- NIST will develop an OS boot loader to allow for multiple operating choices in vehicles, with an open market place to purchase these operating systems and run in the vehicle.

- NIST will take control of the standards between the vehicle and and operating systems that will be available to the market. Currently these are being guarded by Apple and Google.

- Consumers will have a right to choose their operating system at time of purchasing a vehicle, or any time after they purchase a vehicle.

- All vehicles operating systems will have to choose from a configuration of (x) vehicle display configurations.

- All vehicles must provide a single operating system. If Apple, Google and others want to play in the market they must provide an in-car operating system,
  not requiring a user to have a phone.

- All operating systems must operate on any screen configuration so it can be transferable between vehicles, where operational filters can be filtered in and out.

- All vehicle operating systems must be approved by the NHTSA before being released based on their requirements using AI and manual procedures.

- Authorization happens with a camera that must be installed on all vehicles, or code entry to bind a personal profile to the vehicle. For example, a camera would identify a user and receive the oAuth key's from their personal profile where it would be cached locally to work with external services.

- The OS Container will receive AI "glitches" from driver assisted technology sub-system with the GPS location, and a picture.

- Provide road condition information to DOT for example a pot hole that jolts the vehicle where it can be distributed to municipalities for repair.

- Provide the location to the Highway Patrol of an intoxicated driver based on vehicle inputs (breaking, swerving,etc).

- Provide location to the highway patrol if items are in the road and need be removed.

- All vehicles will have a 100 meter RF network that will turn down card radio with a notification an emergency vehicle is the area. using FCC FREQ : xxxxxx, that will be swapped with operating system daily as frequencies permit.
