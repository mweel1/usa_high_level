# Department of Government Over site

The government over site organization will ensure backups and concession plans are available for all critical services including:

## Homeland Security DNS System

Government over-site will have a secondary DNS system integrated into operating systems in case Home Land Security is not available and as fallback option.

## Homeland Security Personal Licensing Service

The homeland security personal licensing service will be replicated, and ready with a DNS change in case of a security breech with Homeland Security.
