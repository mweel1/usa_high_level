# Roadways and Signage

The DOT would provide grants to districts that would be in charge of managing all their map data that would include :

- Roadway Details
- Sidewalk Details
- Signage
- Traffic Patterns would come from both mobile phones, and vehicle operating systems via the GPS system via the us geographical survey where it would be provided down stream to jurisdictions for local use.

These jurisdictions must be cities or counties. A no overlap may be present.

## Subscribing to Data

Anyone could subscribe to their areas .traffic-pattern domain to replicate data to based on the jurisdiction. For govt use it would be no cost, for the public it would be a monthly cost based on the amount data.
