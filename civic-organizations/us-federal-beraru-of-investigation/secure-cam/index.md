## Overview:

Secure-Cam is a government-authorized surveillance system designed for use in high-privacy areas such as hotel rooms and bathrooms. All video footage is fully encrypted from the device to the servers and cannot be accessed without proper legal authorization.

## Access Protocol:

- Video content is encrypted and stored on secure-cam.gov
- Access to any footage requires a court-issued warrant. Only a judge may authorize such a warrant, based on a showing of probable cause and in accordance with applicable privacy and constitutional protections. This request can make in the court system.
- Once authorized, the footage will be made accessible exclusively through the court system for official legal proceedings.
- The court must use people outside of the state for these incidents, where all names will be reacted.

## Transparency and Public Awareness:

- Public announcements will be made to inform citizens about the deployment of Secure-Cam systems and the technology that ensures their security and integrity.

## Device Security and Validation:

- Each Secure-Cam device will be registered with a unique device ID and encryption key.

- An official validation application will allow authorized personnel to verify the authenticity and status of each camera. This will be done with a QR Code, and a domain zone button.

- Validation must be conducted physically on-site by facility personnel, whose authority is confirmed by the facility’s operating license.

- A limited seal that houses the camera must be present, and not present in the market under any terms.

## Data Access Controls:

• Access to content will only be available for judges in other states and the court by entering the ID on the camera provided by local police.

## Cameras

- FBI would also manage the cameras in the plane, and have an on-board server that is synced up with secure-cam.gov after landing. Or in cases where bandwith capabilities exist it will stream them in real-time. The FAA can request camera footage from the FBI to prosecute passengers.
