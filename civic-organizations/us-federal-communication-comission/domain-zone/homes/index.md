# Domain Zones for Homes

When logging into the FCC it will ask for a mortgage from your personal profile.

If you have it, it will allow you to have ownership of the domain zone and add applications, or have devices add applications.

Mortgage holders can give access to renters if they would like to manage the applications at the house.
