# Emergency Dispatch

A grant will be provided to license dispatch service people, and containers for local dispatch operations under .emergency-dispatch containers.

An oAuth with a personal profile and FCC containers will provide the ability to:

1. Allow operating systems to receive a directory of their closest dispatch operation, and connect to dispatch with a standard API surface to:

   - Make Calls
   - Provide Communication Channel via Direct Messaging

All calls to the dispatch organization must provide their personal profile, or NTIS device Id if no personal profile is available.

## Emergency Service Officer Locations

All officer locations would be provided to the dispatch system by oAuthing to the police departments, ambulance providers, and fire services where officers cell phone locations would be available.

## Dispatch Application

Each emergency service officers would have a dispatch log application where they could acknowledge they are responding.

These applications would be deployed in the domain zone for people with these licenses.
