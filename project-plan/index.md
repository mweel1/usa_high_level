# National Parks

Many technologies in this plan have dependencies on state and federal jurisdictions the goal would be to implement these on behalf of the federal and state, and when this is ready to be implemented in other spheres of influence those services would have to be extended in places far away enough to not disrupt the supply chain.

All requirements and standards on technology providers would have to be met in new spheres of influence, a supply chain plan would be deployed for rapid deployment. Large suppliers would have to be ready to fullfil the needs based on the deployment strategy.

## Incorporate a Santiago Action Park.

A corporate/government partnership would be created where Santiago Park would be a non-profit business. The USA would hold the technology licenses and this will be an undercover meeting.

For the technology, the santiago district would get:

1. Federal Lands
2. Santiago Park Tourism Oversight District
3. Grant money to develop local park municipality services.
4. ACH Transfers based on the need of the bank and their loan officers for future projects.

## Banking Services

If one chooses they can goto [banking services](./banking-services/) and receive an RFID coin.

## Driving into Santiago Park

Apple and Google release a sphere capability with the FCC based on [sphere events](/sphere-events/).

This loads an interface which includes all the applications for the Santiago Park at the "District" Level.

One of the first applications would be to buy a pass for the park.

# Social Security Personal Profile

The social security will release a [personal profile](/grants/personal-profile/) that will allow people to:

1. Add government Id
2. Credit Cards
3. Debit Cards

# Purchasing a Pass

You would select the application to purchase a pass.

Once you purchased the park pass it would go into your wallet from the ticket services [ticket service](/tickets/) where it would be stored remotely and locally using the [touch bluetooth](/touch-bluetooth/).

Once at the park gates you would do a [Touch Bluetooth](/touch-bluetooth/) and gain
access to the park trails based on the hours and trail usage.

# Beer Garden

The beer garden will have licensed servers, who login to the beer garden point of sale system.

Using Restaurant Permit Process 1 the following process would be followed:

The beer garden will have a public API.

By pressing a button in the beer garden restaurant the sphere applications would load for the business type of restaurant which must comply with all applications for restaurant permit process 1.

In this case, The following applications would be available:

## Order

the ability to order a beer from the menu would be shown. An order would be be placed to the beer garden from the application using their public API.

## Suggestion Box

A suggestion box would be sent to the API of the business.

## Reviews

The reviews would come from a directory of review organizations, where customer reviews can be handled. Using the jury service, reviews can be tried with a jury of their peers.

When the order is received with the wallet url from the customer, a request from the beer garden to the bank is made with a transaction key, this transaction key with a callback URL, and Order Review URL is sent to the wallet where they are presented with their order summary and approve payment.

The transaction is also checked with the [transaction safety](/transaction-saftey/).

Once the mtn biker acknowledges the order summary the amount, the wallet URL and Bank Transaction ID, receipt is sent to the bank where the money is transferred directly between two parties the callback URL is called to the businesses API system order confirmed.

Once the order is confirmed, the business would send the receipt to the personal wallet, and to the bank.

# Approach for New Businesses and Government Agencies

## Standards Definition and Implementation

As we develop other business software companies will be invited in to take care of the internal management of applications and must agree to :

[b2b](/grants/b2b-standards/)
[b2c](/grants/b2c-standards/) standards
[b2g](/grants/b2g-standards/) standards

## Licensing

Permits for business licenses must be defined before the business can be started if one has not already been defined.

All applications must support logins of licensed users for that business type.

## Media

### Music Content

A musician would produce an album in the public recording studio which would be paid for by grant for education, and rent time for use.

The musician would create a band business and add the content to the business.

They would then add it to whatever networks they chose to to be discovered on.

If the content is found on a network, their business url would be provided with the transaction where they would be paid a predefined commission on purchase.

### Media Sites

A person who produces content would put them up for sale on various market places.

A media site would buy content from the producers via the market place where the user would be able to :

- Consume Content
- Purchase Tickets
- Purchase Products

The consumer would view content by previewing, and then paying a transaction fee to view the entire article.

The original content owners business name would always be displayed with the content.

# Utilities

All utilities will be negotiated, purchased and sold. All utility usage of the district will be available in the [distinct utility](/grants/utility-data-warehouse) data warehouse. This data can be married up to all kinds of attributes to understand the health of a district.
