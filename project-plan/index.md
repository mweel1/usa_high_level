## Incorporate a Silverado Park.

Funds are received from a technology transfer agreement of the park where we get the

1. Federal Lands
2. Grant money to develop local park municipality services.
3. Bank loans as the the board sees fit.

## Banking Services

If one chooses they can goto [banking services](./banking-services/) and receive an RFID coin.

## You drive into Silverado Park.

Apple and Google release a sphere capability with the FCC based on [sphere events](/sphere-events/).

This loads an interface which includes all the applications for the area for both Google and Apple. I would like to get HTML5 working correctly.

One of the first applications would be to buy a pass for the park.

# Setup Park Wallet

If you currently do not have a wallet setup.

Depending on the wallet contents a synchronization occurs between the two wallets where you can confirm the addition, update and removal of items.

A secure connection to the resort bank is made between the wallet the resort bank.

# Purchasing a Pass

You would select the application to purchase a pass.

Once you purchased the park pass it would go into your wallet as a parking pass.

Once at the park gates you would do a [Touch Bluetooth](/touch-bluetooth/) and gain
access to the park.

# Beer Garden

The beer garden will have licensed servers.

Using Restaurant Permit Process 1.

The beer garden will have a public API.

When walking into the beer garden restaurant business application store will be shown.

From there you can view at the standard restaurant menu application and order beer by selecting beers from the menu. An order will be placed to the beer garden with the resort bank.

When the order is received with the wallet url from the customer, a request from the beer garden to the bank is made with a key, this key with a callback URL is sent to the wallet where they are presented with their order summary.

The transaction is also checked with the [transaction safety](/transaction-saftey/).

Once the mtn biker acknowledges the order summary the amount, the wallet URL and Bank Transaction ID is sent to the bank where the money is transferred and the callback URL is called to the businesses API system order confirmed.
