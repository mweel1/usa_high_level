# Operating and Application Certification Process

Each operating system that was deployed into the market place would have to go through a certification process to ensure the following:

- The [government OS services](/government-os-services/) are implemented correctly.
- All browser, e-mail clients must provide the [American Internet domain requirements](/government-os-services/).

Each OS would have a hash associated to it and must be displayed in the operating system.
