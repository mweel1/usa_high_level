# Banking

We will develop a local bank, where the federal reserve will connect us to the ACH system.

Like the grant system the federal reserve will allocate capital based on categories and needs determined by the local banks planning loan officers.

For example, if our market needs more chicken coupe management companies rates can be lowered accordingly, or a high rise building.

Each loan office would have discretion of their banks funds to provide loans that would be based on their licensing guidelines.

A licensed bank wealth manager would manage the flow of capital from citizens and issue credit for people needing it during the transaction processes.

Transaction processing will occur by adding all your bank cards to your personal profile, this includes all major credit cards and debit cards, along with your local bank card and accounts.

All facilities will use a single platform to process transactions between merchant and customer.

Any transactions that is processed will be sent to both the personal server and the bank transaction.

- A receipt with [upc](/grants/upc/) data will be sent
- The physical location if it exists
- The domain name

[personal profile](/grants/personal-profile/).

Any transactions that has a product safety issue will be able send the UPC information
