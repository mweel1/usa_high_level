# Banking

The United States banking system will be a unified platform that will allow a federal reserve board the ability to make allocations to various cities based on the backlog of requirements of various banking jurisdictions needs.

Each city will have their own licensed bankers that will loan money for various projects as long as all business license requirements are met.

Credit will be issued by these banks via credit cards that will be issued to their [personal profile](/grants/personal-profile/).

Since the system will be unified we will have transactional integrity of all transactions, making corruption impossible that our current financial system today allows.
