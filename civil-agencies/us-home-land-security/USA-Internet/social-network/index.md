# Government Licensing Agency and Social Network

## Government Social Network

Government communications are a big problem. Users are using different platforms that are corporate owned and insecure.

Homeland Security will develop a social network much like Linked In where:

- It will be organized by the top level agency, and the children agencies.
- Each one will have a social feed where they can communicate with government agencies.
- Each government agent will have direct communication capabilities with each other, or groups and will consider them secure in the role of their job duties.
