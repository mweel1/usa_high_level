Personal Profile Provisioning and Child Protection Device Integration

During the provisioning of a personal profile, it will connect to the Child Electronic Device Protection Service (CEDPS), a division operating under the Federal Trade Commission. This connection facilitates the management of child protection features for both children and guardians, as well as the devices and individuals associated with them.

Once the OAuth process is completed, service keys will be securely stored in the personal profile. As part of this process, CEDPS will request authorization to access information about devices and legal guardians. This authorization is required for continued use of the protection services.

Legal guardian status within the system is automatically revoked when a child turns 18, as defined by the Social Security Administration, or upon receipt of a relevant court order submitted to the personal profile.

Each device must have an owner associated with it in the personal profile. Operating systems are required to maintain an up-to-date link with the personal profile and must provide functionality to update it as needed.

When a new device is purchased the device provider must link it to the personal profile. This done via an oAuth process to the personal profile where the device manufacturer receives keys to update the personal profile with a UL Id.

Anytime the device changes ownership, the device must be removed from the personal profile.

The device owner must provide a capability to add personal profiles in which they would like to monitor and control at the point of purchase.

CEDPS will use this linkage to maintain device control and enforce access policies.

Device owners will have the following capabilities through CEDPS:

1. Capture screenshots of the device at any time.
2. Monitor screen content and transmit audio/video to a linked device.
3. Set simple operating hours.
4. Configure advanced screen time schedules based on both the categories of domains, or the domains themselves.
5. Turn off device indefinitely
6. Turn on device indefinitely
7. Turn off device for x minutes

Note: This system is intended solely for child protection purposes and is not for business use.

# Applications

In the government section of domain zones at the federal level, the federal trade commission will have a domain application group, where child monitoring application will be available and parents can manage their guardian, and owned devices where permissions exists.

## Default Settings

The federal government will create default settings for parents which can be changed.

[Public service announcement](/public-service-announcements/) will be created about teaching children about the dangers of meeting people on-line and on-line usage.
