# Band

The Chamber of Commerce business process type would be a band selling music to personal profiles for a download price.

A .band API would have a albums, and songs that can be uploaded that would have to be tagged, approved, categorized on the content filtering system and uploaded to the connected media server where it would be stored. Per download price would be given by the media content service per song.

# /catalog
