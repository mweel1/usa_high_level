# US Drug Enforcement Agency

The US Drug Enforcement Agency will provide containers for operations, licenses to operators, and domain name approvals to Home Land Security.

# Legalization

The case for legalization of all drugs is a strong one, given:

- People are dying from having illicit materials in our supply chain
- Quality
- Fighting between cartels
- Drug dealers are not responsible to their users

# Manufacturing Regulations

Licensed pharmaceutical manufacturing entities must comply with the following requirements:

- Hold a certified .pharmaceutical-manufacturer license.
- Use DEA-approved, tamper-evident containers for all products, purchased from authorized vendors from the DEA supplier directory.
- Ensure containers are designed to support proper drug storage and break a seal when opened.
- Register each product with the DEA to receive a unique identifier, including:

  - Prefix M (for Manufacturer)
  - Drug ID
  - Unique serial number

- Use only UL-licensed drug manufacturing equipment.

- License and provide containers for drug farms.
- Deliver only through authorized .drug-transportation services.
- List products on DEA-approved networks with domain names authorized by the DEA under .pharmaceutical-network via Homeland Security.

# Retail Regulations

Licensed pharmaceutical retail businesses must:

- Ensure order management systems comply with FinCEN transaction safety protocols (rules developed in consultation with the FDA).
- Ensure order management system do not sell expired products when scanning out.
- Use UL-certified dispensing machines to transfer wholesale drugs to customer containers.
- Register retail-level product codes while dispensing where:

  - Prefix R (for Retail)
  - Drug ID
  - Unique serial number
  - Customerâ€™s Social Security Number

- Maintain secure inventory systems, to ensure every product that comes in what sold.
- Ensure UL cold storage with expiration processes in place.
- Purchase only from certified .pharmaceutical-network sources.
  - Accept deliveries exclusively from licensed .drug-transportation providers.
  - Be located within walkable distance for most customers to manage distribution (e.g., if a user is allowed one ecstasy pill per month, they must visit the store monthly).
  - Employ licensed pharmacists to manage operations.
  - Ensure certified personnel are available for drugs requiring specific expertise.
  - Offer application access to social services for individuals needing support or financial aid.

# Legal Framework

The DEA would establish a comprehensive legal system governing drug use at both federal and local levels:

- Existing federal laws would be integrated into the system, and Schedule A drugs would be voted on. Any drugs that were not deemed legal the DEA would eradicate it from the market by all means possible, and work with human and health services to help users addicted to it.

- Local districts would be empowered to vote and override specific laws as needed, adapting policy to regional needs while ensuring national oversight.
