# Container Management

Many top level government organizations will be providing application containers to the market to ensure interoperability between business, people and government.

NITS approves the application container by:

- Ensure the licenses are requested correctly during login for Social Security login process.
- Ensure the B2B and G2G standards are implemented correctly based on the NITS Processes Id.
- Ensure all security requirements are met for web applications.

Once approved, NITS will place the container in a registry and categorize it based on the civil agency.

NITS provides a service for various civil agencies to:

- Receive a directory of container applications for that civil agency.
- Provide a list of authorized hosting providers.
- Allow the provisioning a container with a domain name that is sent to Homeland Security.
