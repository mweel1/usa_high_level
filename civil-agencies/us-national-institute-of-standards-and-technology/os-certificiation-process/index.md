# NTIS Operating System Testing and Certification

## Organizational Presence

The following organizations will have a formal presence and/or contact at the National Technology Integration System (NTIS), as will other large market operating system manufacturers.

- Apple
- Google
- Microsoft
- Social Security Administration (to support development of the Personal Profile system)

## Comprehensive Testing

Having operating systems manage their own release cycles is a security risk for the market due their influence in the population.

NTIS will conduct comprehensive testing across all operating systems. These tests will simulate full interaction with government functions to ensure compatibility, performance, and security.

### Mobile and Desktop Platform Standards

- NTIS will provide deployment servers for operating systems once they have been approved.

- Each software release must include a cryptographic hash that is visible on the about section of all operating systems for reporting purposes.

- All operating systems must be tested for roll-back reliability.

## Certification Requirements for Desktop and Mobile OS

Before deployment in the marketplace, all operating systems must pass certification ensuring the following:

- Government Branding Control: Devices may not display government seals unless retrieved through a personal profile.
- Communication Standards: Government emails must be clearly identified and displayed accurately in client software.
- Emergency Messaging: Emergency communication messages must be correctly formatted and prominently displayed from FEMA. FEMA must have test capabilities in their system to test these.
- National Security Compatibility: All required NSA functions must operate reliably.
- Key Management: Key storage must be securely managed through the personal profile and direct connect to emergency notification system.
- Application Zone Controls: Application zone buttons must function correctly.
- Local Dispatch: Local emergency dispatch capabilities must operate as intended with FEMA.
- Child Protection: Devices must include working child protection and parental control features by the FTC.
- Browser Integrity: Browsers must validate that the client originated from the server in which is was served from.
- Ensure all government seal borders around government e-mails, and websites.

## AI Assistance and Privacy Legislation

NTIS will provide standards for AI smart speakers where when setting up the user must confirm if they would like to use their AI speaker to call authorities during certain events.

    1. Yes, Always – AI systems must always monitor for abuse.
    2. Yes, When Opted-In – AI systems may monitor only with user consent.
    3. Never – AI systems are not permitted to monitor for abuse under any circumstances.

Even though we might assume the answer to be #2, it's good to public input because to ensure they are part of the process.

AI Speakers could listen in for spousal abuse, gun shots, and child abuse.
