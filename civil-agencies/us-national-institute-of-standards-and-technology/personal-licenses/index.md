# License

The NITS will provide a standard in which all license IDs are defined.

For example, for a general contractor it would be:

hud.gov:1231

This would provide any service the ability to query hud.gov/license with the ID where they can receive the entire license payload.

Each top level government agency will define their own license attributes for the market place.
