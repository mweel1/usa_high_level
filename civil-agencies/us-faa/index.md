# United Stated Federal Aviation

All airports would be nationalized, all airlines would have to implement the G2G and G2B specification between the airport-sna.gov, faa.gov and .airplanes.

# Reservations

NITS would provide the standards for airports to take booking reservations, where domain applications can be deployed on a map or a directory.

The following are the business requirements:

- Allow citizens to book air flights, helicopter flights, and drone flights.
- All tickets provided and sold, must be serviced by the airport and abide by the return policies deemed by the airport govt's legislation.
- A commission can be provided to partners, where the airport must pay the partner and must ensure they handle all service and sales.

The airport would have to have B2B a specification, and the FAA would manage the approved zone application that integrated with the B2B specification.

# Legislation

The FAA would have a federal legislation that airplan advertisements are acceptable.

Local FAA laws could be over ridden to band these.

# Licensing

## .pilot

The FAA would provide .pilot licenses with enforcement capabilities to handle passengers.

## .capitan

The FAA would provide .capitan licenses with enforcement capabilities to handle passengers, and contact local authorities via the .airport API
where licensed .airport-police would transfer them to .police.

The FAA would provide .sturdiest licenses with enforce capabilities to handle passengers.
Which might include:

- Cuffing people
- Bear Spray Usage

# Aircraft Licensing

The FAA would approve all aircraft and issue a license to the vehicle.

They would also license all the testing equipment and .flight-inspectors for aircraft. This could be done with hangers and advanced scanning equipment.

Every aircraft must provide a .aircraft container to provide services with the FAA which would include scheduling them for routes and receiving location updates to the FAA airports.
