# Suggestion Box

A suggestion box application would be provided at a restaurant.

The suggestion box will ask you to log-in to receive the personal profile.

The customer can right a suggestion.

The internal system could mary up the order with the personal profile.

The device in the kitchen could mark when they are working on an order and mary up the chef with the order to help correct his work.
