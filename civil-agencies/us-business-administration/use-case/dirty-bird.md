# Dirty Bird

Dirty Bird is bar and music venue in Laguna Beach CA, where a ticket price is charged. Bands play on a schedule.

A business process specification would be defined at the chamber of commerce for this process, along with all top level .gov organizations and their licenses that are required.

The business would go to the chamber of commerce and select the Bar & Venue Category, and then then request a business license, where the closest licensed business licensing agent would be deployed to the business.

# Licensing

In the case of required licenses for this business process you would have:

- Chamber of Commerce Process - Owner/Manager
- DOJ Providing Security
- Alcohol and Tobacco provide alcohol license

This would be defined at the chamber of commerce based on the process specification.

# SBA Business License (Local Jurisdiction/City)

A SMB small business licensor would be versed in the business process and all the requirements around it. For this business process Id, it would include:

- Stage Safety
- Sound Safety
- People Counting
- Approved Business Operating System from NTIS to enforce license logins.
- Fire Safety
- Are noise level devices reporting to FTC

The agent doing the business permitting process would ensure the owner or manager has all appropriate personal licenses to operate this business process.

They would do this by using RFID Touch where the owner would provide all the licenses needed to run this chamber process using their business licensor check license application.

Once approved, they would provide the business license with the chamber process Id.

# API Surface

Bands that would be playing would have a schedule and set-list and would have to have a city license for the band.

# Small Business Application

Once all licenses were in hand, they would be able to goto the chamber of commerce and install an application for their business which would include the Server/API and Domain Zone Application on approved hosting providers.

The small business operating system would need to already be approved by the NTIS where all license requirements would be defined. For example:

- Are the bands licensed that are added to the set list.
- Are the licensed alcohol person(s) logging into to deliver drink orders.
- Has the set list gone through content filtering system approval
- Are security personal logging in to check Id's with a security domain app.
- Are there applications in-place to count people being reported to the fire department

The Small Business Administration would have to manage the license requirements of the staff to the chamber of commerce, where the NTIS would approve operating systems for that business process Id.
