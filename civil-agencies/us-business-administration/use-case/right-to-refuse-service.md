# Right to Refuse Service

You see in a lot of old American business with old signs right to refuse anyone for service.

All businesses would be created with the ability to apply and request personal profile information.

If the business didnt have this ability, they would send the calling party a response that the service is not implemented at this time. All business processes at chamber of commerce would have to have all services implicated for in this case a restaurant.

Authorization can happen at the personal profile, or business + personal profile.

If they implemented the service, they would return a JSON form (NTIS Specification xxxx), or their website would use that JSON form to show it on their website and they would apply.

The business would receive applications.

When approved they would give the person a license.

All these business would have access control on them to allow entry.
