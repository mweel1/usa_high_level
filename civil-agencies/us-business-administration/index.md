The US Small Business Administration, would be renamed to Business Administration.

The Business Administration would determine the business license requirements for all parcels in the country, along with other government agencies including:

- National Institute for Technology Standards

- Environmental Protection Agency

Grants would be provided to each jurisdiction to do physical inspections and manage their business license .business-inspection containers.

# .business-inspection

The business business license business container at various jurisdictions will allow to:

- Approve a license for a certain business type
- Ensure the business is setup correctly at the FCC with a correct domain zone profile and b2b specification from the commerce department.
- Each time a business permit is re-associated with a domain zone its cleared.

Different licenses would be needed based on the b2b specification type to approve the business starting up, or on an on-going basis where it would be reviewed based on its expiration date.

Local FBI field offices would visit all the businesses in their field to make sure the licenses in the domain zone are operating as they should at their discretion.

There would be different types of licensed business inspectors.

The chamber of commerce of would have a list of required licenses that are required for the businesses process specification.

There would be a business inspector for the following types of businesses:

    - Micro-Machine Approval – Inspectors ensure that all micromechanical devices used in consumer or industrial products meet safety, durability, and precision manufacturing standards before being sold or integrated into larger systems.

    - Food Service & Safety – Inspectors evaluate restaurants, food trucks, and food processing facilities for hygiene, storage, and food handling practices to prevent contamination and ensure compliance with health regulations.  They would also ensure all products had RFID chips, and all containers and machines were handling expiration dates correctly.

    - Electronics & Consumer Devices – Inspectors test electronics for quality control, electromagnetic interference compliance, battery safety, and adherence to energy efficiency guidelines.

    - Clothing and Textile Manufacturing – Inspectors check factories for labor standards, material quality, fire safety, and compliance with environmental regulations related to dyes and waste.

    - Chemical and Pharmaceutical Products – Inspectors assess production facilities for adherence to chemical handling protocols, dosage accuracy, and packaging standards to ensure consumer safety.  We get these from corporate America's current standards.

    - Retail and Warehousing Operations – Inspectors evaluate storefronts and warehouses for compliance with fire codes, accessibility standards, proper labeling, and safe storage of inventory.

    - Financial Services & Insurance – Inspectors audit companies for fair practices, regulatory compliance, and transparency in pricing, claims, and consumer interaction.

    - Ticket Venues - Ticket Venues would be approved by having licenses from the FTC, security from the DOJ, and Firearms and Tobacco and Alcohol licenses.  They would also ensure all electronics, stages, and sound met industry standards.
