## Business License

US Department of Commerce will provide grants, education, and application containers to the market to manage the process of issuing business licenses.

## Web Based Interface

All organization processes must provide an API and a web application for users. For example, a person might want to go to the business and look at the hours they are assigned to work.

## Every open business process (OBP) will have a specific set of requirements. Open business processes for example would be:

1. Restaurant
2. Bar's

One of the first requirements of the specifications is that they have a single use. Even if a bar is in a restaurant, they must be separate.

Domain Zones can overlap in areas, and the business could technically be the same owner.

The business process specifications would include:

1. Backend API
2. Internal API
3. Customer Facing API

A specification would be created with all API surfaces.

Businesses would have to publish which ones they implemented in their /licenses/api-services.

## City

Once a city receives a grant to manage the business license, and installs their application container.

They have the tools and technologies available to go through a predefined inspection based on the type of business.

Once the inspection is done, a business license will be sent to the personal profile.

This will be accomplished by going to the business license application, and entering your company domain name. When submitting a request for license, the personal profile will provide a unique URL to place the business license in the personal profile onces its approved.
