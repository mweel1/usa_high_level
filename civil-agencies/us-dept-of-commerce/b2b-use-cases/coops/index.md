# Chicken Coops

.chicken-coop would have a business type.

With that business type, training and service providers would be available.

They would produce eggs with your land.

They would put it on a community market and send inventory when its available.

Customers would purchase and have it delivered by delivery drivers same day, or they would be stored for the owner in their home.
