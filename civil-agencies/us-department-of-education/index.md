# Federal Department of Education

The Federal Department of Education will serve as both a technology and supply provider, offering grants and support to school districts. Through this system, districts will receive funding and resources, with the department also playing a role in helping manage district operations.

## Starting a School

Starting a school requires:

- Finding a shool district
- Receive the proper teaching licensing
- Finding enrolment (for public grant funds)
- Securing funding private schools or receive grant funding for public schools.

### Licensing

A teacher is [licensed](./teacher-license-requirements/) to become a teacher, where their license is placed in their personal profile. Anyone doing on-line education must be licensed with a skill paths so it can be used in circum.

A list of educational opportunities for teachers to become licensed at the department of education will be available at the department of education's website.

The department of education will provide statistics to allow teachers to find markets to work in.

### Directory

A directory of schools and districts will be provided via Homeland Security which include children schools, colleges, and/or trade schools.

## Managing Schools

### Districts

Districts are created at the district levels for the next semester by:

- An accumulation of schools that fill all subject matter required by the DOE.
- Enrollment completed for the following semester in all schools.
- Teacher salaries will be voted on by the district board.

### Schools

Once a teacher is licensed they will have the ability to register a .school domain and use a licensed .school container that will integrate from the district to the DOE using G2G standards with with NITS.

### Credit Requirements

Each district will responsible to ensure that children receive credits in all [subjects](./subjects/) at various [skills paths](./skills-path/) through out their education, and report to the federal DOE.

## Department of Education Platform

- Allow parents to view a directory of .schools in various district.

- Provide the ability for vendors to provide books and other media to the school system where they are aligned with education requirements. For example, a math book might teach basic arithmetic, where that would be a aligned with that a certain skill path and subject.

- Provide a portal for parents and teachers to collaborate on school districts, including setting them up and discussing issues.

- Issue skill path certificates as students are enrolled, learning, and completed.

- Receive reporting from .districts to monitor education at the federal level.

- Provide a directory of .exam domains that can be taken for various subjects and skill paths that can be used by the school.

## School Application

The department of education will provide the containers from .school technology providers for teachers and their classes. This will include the ability to:

- Allow children to enroll in a school
- Allow teachers to assign learning web resources to their class from the DOE.
- Allow teachers to set grades for classes and report them to the DOE.
- Expose and manage class schedules and report them to the DOE.
- Provide exams, and share them with parents and the DOE.
- Expose and manage grades for classes at each skill path.
- Communication platform with parents and teachers.
- Vaccine's have been administered, and verified at the Dept. of Health.
- Provide videos of sports and classes.
- Provide reporting data to the district.

## Teacher Training

The DOE will have training directories available for teachers to receive their licenses to teach.

The DOE will have all types of schools available for teachers to get licensed. Learning can be on-line services, trade schools, or colleges.

## School Location Objective

The primary objective of expanding grant opportunities is to ensure that an adequate number of school facilities are available within walking distance of urban residential areas. These grants will support the acquisition and development of neighborhood-based school sites, including the transformation of residential properties into educational facilities, as well as the construction of city-wide sports complexes.

Properties will be acquired through voluntary sales, with offers made to willing sellers at 20–30% above assessed value. Once acquired, these properties will be owned jointly by the school district and the Department of Education (DOE). In the event that a district is unable to sustain the facility or meet its operational obligations, ownership responsibilities will transfer fully to the DOE, which will then manage the sale or repurposing of the property.

## Reporting

The Department of Education (DOE) will collaborate with the Social Security Administration to collect demographic data, enabling the prediction of school enrollment trends based on the age distribution of households in various regions. This foresight will support more effective planning for licensing, funding, and grant distribution to districts, schools, and teachers.

The DOE will also implement a data-driven approach to ensure it receives comprehensive student and resource projections at least two years in advance. This will allow for better alignment of teacher training programs with anticipated student needs.

To accommodate new enrollments, all schools will maintain a capacity buffer—initially set at 20%—ensuring that every child has access to a classroom seat, even with population fluctuations or unexpected surges.

As part of the enrollment process, students must have all required vaccinations completed. Medical records, including vaccination history and relevant health events, will be securely stored in each student’s personal profile for streamlined access and compliance monitoring.

## Attendance

The DOE platform will empower school districts with the authority and infrastructure to create and enforce attendance-related policies. Districts will be able to initiate legal proceedings through the nearest court system against parents or guardians who consistently fail to ensure their children’s attendance. The platform will include comprehensive reporting tools and case management features to support these actions and ensure due process.

Potential consequences for non-compliance may include:

- Fines imposed on parents or guardians for repeated violations of attendance laws.
- Mandated community service for students, as a corrective and educational measure.
- Referral to specialized educational support services, including potential placement in special education programs where appropriate assessments indicate need.
- Escalation to child protective services in severe or chronic cases where educational neglect may be part of broader welfare concerns.

This integrated system is designed to uphold every child’s right to an education while holding caregivers accountable for school attendance obligations.

## Special Education

Each district must provide at least one special education class to handle all special education needs, to allow children who can't make it to school. The format of this school will be defined at the district level as a single .school.

## Field Trip Transportation

Transportation will be available for field trips, and sporting events with other schools. There will be grants to provide transportation services on behalf of each district by the DOE, based on the requests from districts.

## Supplies

The DOE will provide a platform to allow schools to order and receive all of their supplies. The supplies will be categorized by class and skill path.

The DOE will monitor that over consumption of supplies does not take place.

## School Lunch

Lunch will be provided by the school by bidding out delivery of food services from the market place each week. The funding for lunches will be derived from grant money and will be part of the budget the district submits. Local businesses will be responsible for delivering the food based on schedules where children meet for lunch at a location.

## Use Case

I’m a teacher preparing to lead a computer class focused on a specific skill path.

I obtained my license to teach this subject and skill path by passing a certification test through a licensed training provider approved by the Department of Education.

After organizing student enrollment, I applied for a grant to support the operation of the program within the school district from the district.

Once funding is secured, I goto the Department of Education, where I am issued a .school domain name. This domain is configured through NITS-approved application providers, which requires licensing to receive and operate. Using the grant funds. I then selected the curriculum and exams relevant to the skill path and integrated them into my school. The .school domain is linked to a specific domain zone so parents can find me. This can be at a specific location, or assigned to the city.

Finally, I returned to the DOE to collect teaching supplies, based on the enrollment data.
