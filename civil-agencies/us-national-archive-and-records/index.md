# U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (USNARA)

The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (USNARA) would serve as the central repository for aggregating all laws across civil agencies.

It would maintain a comprehensive database of laws, categorized by their source, legal content, domain area, jurisdiction level (federal, state, or local), and the responsible enforcement authority.

USNARA would also offer a public-facing application that allows users to access relevant laws based on their current location by simply pressing a “Laws” button on their phone.
