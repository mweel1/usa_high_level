# Department of Justice

The department of justice will run the court system for all civic related matters including run court cases, managing the laws in various jurisdictions, and licensing security forces.

# Laws

All federal, state and city laws will be added to the platform when it's brought up. No county and city laws may overlap.

There is a board at the on-line,federal, state and city level. Who approve all laws brought by the public.

Any downstream law that is voted on the public, must receive an approval from the jurisdiction above. For example, city laws need to be approved by the state board. State laws need to be approved by federal boards.

Once a city law is approved by a state for example, all cities do not need a hire approval.

Any law can be proposed by citizens, where the citizens vote on it, and the board approves.

Any law can be revoked by citizens, where the citizens vote on it, and the board approves.

It will be the job of the boards in each jurisdiction to add their laws to the platform on startup.

All people who vote must have a residency in that jurisdiction by a rental agreement, or title.

DOJ will vote on if criminal history should be public released by the local court, or available in local media licenses.

# On-Line Reporting

Citizens will have the ability to report content on-line to the department of justice based on the on-line laws. For example President Trump made a law Deep Fakes, and revenge porn are illegal.

All on-Line DOJ reporting links will have a key associated with it, once a warrant is issued. The DOJ can request the actual content based on the key. This will include the content, and the actual person that account belonged to.

Content must be saved for 90 days from the date it posted.

We will use the same mechanism for this that social security uses to report people that need help.

# Licenses

## Accolades and Complaints

All licensed agents of the DOJ would have to have a RFID card to provide to citizens if requested. When scanning it, it would goto doj.gov/licenses/police-officer/MMDDYYYY-000001

The license would provide:

1. Avatar to verify their identity
2. First Name

File an accolade, or complaint

The DOJ would be responsible for replacing stolen, or lost RFID cards as part of the developed NTIS licensing container deployed by Homeland Security and served on doj.gov/licensing

Certified government agents would create education companies and the keys.

Once certified, jurisdictions can choose to hire them on in their budget.

## Security Guards

Security Guards will be licensed.

All licensed will be started federally, where downstream jurisdiction exception could be voted on and added.

Security guards will have metrics around the amount of businesses and the amount of security guards, and must have all budgets approved by the board. For example, Laguna Beach would have a Security Guard Force Jurisdiction and hire accordingly. If the public felt there was to much security, and not a lot of crime that could be brought up to the board with up votes on the complaint.

# Detention Facilities

All detention facilities must have FBI camera system installed by a licensed .fbi-camera-installers, and managed by an .fbi-camera-management in the nearest district. The work will be bid out to the market based on the needs.
