    - Arrest Warrant – Issued when there is probable cause someone committed a crime.
    - Search Warrant – Issued to search for evidence in a specific place.
    - Bench Warrant – Issued by a judge, often when someone fails to appear in court.
    - FBI Video Release Warrant

A [government certificate's](/us-home-land-security/government-certificates-social-network/) with all associated board members across the board will be allowed to submit a warrant.

Each board at member at:

- Police Station Boards
- ICE
- Home Land Security
- National Park Rangers
- DEA
- DOJ

## Reporting

All warrant information is made public to DOJ agents, with a picture and a name and placed on the transaction filtering system where they can track their location.

All licensed DOJ agents with an arrest license can make an arrest and send them to jail via licensed .jail-transport organization where they are transported to the closest .jail for sentencing and hearing via the library computer systems where a [court case](../court/index.md) is procured on the DOJ.GOV website.

## Transaction Safety Filter

The DOJ will have a [transaction safety filter](/us-national-institute-of-standards-and-technology/transaction-safety/) in the transaction safety services to alert the police if people have an outstanding warrant.
