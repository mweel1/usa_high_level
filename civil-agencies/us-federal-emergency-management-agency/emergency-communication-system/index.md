## Emergency Communication Systems

The emergency communication system would allow government agencies the ability to send direct messages and actions to operating system much like what happens with TV and radio today based on the agencies permissions.

## Logins

Each government agency would need permission to use the emergency communication system. Some examples might be:

- Highway Patrol
- Police Department
- Fire Department
- Water District
- Energy Companies
- General Administration
- Animal Control
- Weather Agency
- Lifeguard

Each user must have a valid government license from Homeland Security to login.

Each login will have access limits to which districts they can send messaging out to.

## Devices

All physical communication devices/operating systems would be registered with the Emergency Communication System via the personal profile where they would be notified in case of emergencies.

Furthermore, the FCC/NITS device would have a direct connection to FEMA incase it does not have a connection to the personal profile.

## Sending Messages

FEMA will provide pre-defined messages that various jurisdictions which will be able to choose from where they will fill in specific fields.

Any time a custom message is sent outside of this, it must be approved by 5 individuals from the customer messaging team at FEMA.

### Location Based Messaging

In the case of location based messages a geo-fence can be provided to ECS where from various jurisdictions can send message to citizens. This information would include both residents physical address, and operating systems in the geo-located area.

Some uses for this technology would be:

- A car driving on the wrong side of the freeway
- Natural disaster notification and procedures (including charging devices, and have cell phone backup devices available).
- A serial killer on the loose in an area
- A lost dog
- Active shooter at school
- Emergency vehicles would emit its location and send messages to turn down the car radio and alert to pay attention for siren noises as it drives down the street.

### Jurisdiction Messaging

The FEMA emergency communication system will also allow you to send emergency notifications to specific districts.

## Operating System Commands

The emergency communication system would be able to provide commands to mobile phones to:

- Disable them incase a gathering are coordinating attacks in a crowd gathering.

The ECS would also be able to provide commands to vehicle operating system via a license plate which would include:

- Turn down the radio
- Send a message to pull a vehicle over
- Disable a vehicle in a pursuit

### Domain Zones

- A command can be sent to operating systems to show an emergency coordination domain zone, where an emergency icon will be shown on devices.
