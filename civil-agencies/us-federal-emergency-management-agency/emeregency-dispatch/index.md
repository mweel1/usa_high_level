# Emergency Dispatch System Overview

A grant will be provided to license dispatch service managers and support containerized technology for local emergency dispatch operations using standardized emergency-dispatch containers.

Furthermore, all emergency equipment will be funded by the grant based on the district/city FEMA board's budget.

All FCC/NITS-approved operating systems will receive a directory of the nearest dispatch centers and will connect through a standardized API to enable the following:

- Place emergency service calls
- Enable communication via direct messaging and domain zone specific applications
- Enable the vehicle to call dispatch during an accident

All calls to dispatch centers must include either a user’s personal profile or the FCC device ID (if no profile is logged in), allowing the system to access the device’s location for emergency responses.

# Emergency Officer and Vehicle Tracking

Dispatch systems will receive real-time GPS coordinates for all registered emergency vehicles and personnel within the district to support accurate location-based response.

# Dispatch Application

Each emergency responder will use a dispatch log application to acknowledge and respond to service calls. These applications will be deployed within the appropriate domain zones and accessible only to licensed personnel.

# Multi-District Coordination

Federal agencies, including FEMA, will have access to the same services as local districts. This ensures coordination across jurisdictions for large-scale emergencies affecting multiple cities or districts.
