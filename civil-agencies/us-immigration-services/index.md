# U.S. Immigration Service

## Overview

The U.S. Immigration Service will rely on personal profiles and the e-visa system to effectively track and manage immigrants and immigration. It will also create immigration districts, and manage holding facilities, and transportation management for deportation.

## Out-of-Country E-Visa Process

All travelers flying into the United States must complete an e-visa personal profile on the U.S. Immigration website. Once completed, an e-visa number with an embedded RFID chip will be issued.

The Immigration Service will manage the e-visa system and ensure that its functionality aligns with personal profiles, while also accommodating exceptions for specific e-visa services.

The National Technology and Information Service (NTIS) will provide the infrastructure for hosting personal profiles used by the Immigration Service.

### Job Placement

Each e-visa application needs to have a job to migrate the country. A job posting and applying capability will be provided on the e-visa system to allow people to apply.

The following licenses must be active to post on the job site:

    - Contractor Owner License (Business, Home)
    - Manufacturing Owner License

A one time payment can be provided to intis immigration candidates.

All job placement must provide sufficient funds for:

1. Transportation
2. Housing
3. Food
4. Entertainment

If the visa applicant already has a job lined up, they must provide the domain. A e-mail is sent to the domain where they must verify at ICE with a handshake.

### Immigration Funding

Each e-visa will include a bank card that must be used for 15 days to:

1. Rent property
2. Purchase a phone from major mobile carriers
3. Travel to place of residence

## Domestic E-Visa Process

Licensed immigration officers at ICE will be authorized to process e-visa applications for current residents upon request.

ICE officers will have access to local police departments to collect:

1. Photographs
2. Fingerprints

Regulations will be established to determine eligibility for enrolling
individuals already on U.S. soil into the e-visa system. Suggested requirements include:

    1. Providing a valid phone number linked to their place of employment
    2. Having no outstanding warrants

## Path to Citizenship

The U.S. Immigration Service will oversee the citizenship application process. The criteria and procedures will be determined by the federal immigration board. Eligible e-visa holders may transition their e-visa personal profile into a full citizen personal profile.

All necessary documentation for personal profiles will be created and recorded, even if initially provided verbally. This will include:

- Birth certificate

## Tracking

All e-visa holders consent to real-time location tracking by ICE agents and the justice department police officers. This data will be accessible to ICE agents, enabling them to identify deported individuals in their immediate vicinity.

# Deportation

ICE will manage the process when people are being deported. This includes:

- Taking them to a jail facility
- Group immigrants based on their destination
- Manage travel plans out of the country, including buses, vehicles and planes.

## Facility Management

All DOJ jails will have to support the intake of jail systems and accept immigrants being deported.
