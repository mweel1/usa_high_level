## Vehicle Licensing

All vehicles must be licensed from the manufacturer with a unique identifier as they are today.

A website to enter a unique ID will be available to bring up all the details of the vehicle, including:

1. The business name, and contact information.
2. Type of vehicle
3. Licenses assigned to vehicle
4. Payload Attributes for querying the the market place

All vehicles must have an RFID chip that can be scanned to bring up the website directly.
