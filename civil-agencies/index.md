# Civil Agencies

## Overview

Civil agencies are designed to foster coordinated governance across federal, state, and city levels vertically, in the context of the mission of the agency.

For example, Social Security would have a federal, and city jurisdiction to provide Social Security services, for example the Social Security in a city would manage homeless shelters not the state that provides this currently.

This approach ensures transparency, accountability, and seamless interaction between jurisdictions, agencies, and citizens. It supports the management of technology, finances, legal processes, education, and licensing across different vertical jurisdictions of government.

Civil organizations provide technology from NITS approved containers to enable jurisdictions to deploy technology, and provide the standards for them to communicate.

There are many advantages to [civil agencies](/civil-agencies/advantages/).

## Government Objectives

### Finance Management

- Enable acceptance of ACH payments from the Federal Reserve to top-level .gov civil agencies based on:

  - Civil agency budget and all downstream jurisdictions budgets. The grants provide to downstream agencies include costs for board members, personnel, technology and infrastructure.

- All top level civil agencies downstream must be on the same budget cycle as the top level .gov domain which is driven from the top level agency bylaws.

- All agencies must have a budget section for the next year (in-progress), and the current year.

- Provide comprehensive budget management tools for agencies across all jurisdictional levels.

- Allow for the special funding requests for projects that were not considered in the financial planning.

### Legislative Management

- Any top level civil agencies, or their downstream civil agencies can be setup for legislative capabilities which would allow people to vote on laws for board consideration.

- All jurisdictions would have to have 3-5 board members and officials within jurisdictions and agencies to propose, amend, or veto laws.

- Any jurisdiction board can vote to move the vote to a different jurisdiction.

- Top level agencies could cancel board votes brought to them.

- If down stream jurisdictions vote on something that is causing issues, a higher jurisdictions can override legislative decisions of lower organizations at any-time with a vote.

- Other citizen government organizations can weigh in on legislative decisions that are being discussed. For example the EPA, might weigh in if FEMA is bidding out a new fleet of fire trucks.

- No non-related civil agency can override another one except for the President. It's suggested the boards include people that have environmental backgrounds. The General Administration Agency will create the requirements for all boards as they are created for various jurisdictions.

## Board Management

Each board consists of a number of members as defined by its bylaws and must have a quorum.

### Starting Up

Federal General Administration will ensure the city general administration has all the resources and know how to bring in other civil agencies into a city to run its operations.

### Data Sharing

All board members must share their financial information to ensure they do not receive kickbacks from the market place. The Civic Over Site Agency will require an oAuth when sworn into an agency.

### Compensation

Today our government employees are not paid enough. This leads to corruption in the govt to make more money, because no dought there job is one of the hardest. Compensation will be determined on the value you bring to the board as part of the budget.

### New Board Members

When board members leave, or got impeached. New board members would have to apply with their rate, where it would be automatically adjusted in the following budget payment from the top level civil agency.

### Terms

The terms are open ended. Once board members are appointed they can be removed by vote.

## Licensing and Certification

Civic Agencies will provide education and licensing based on their duties. For example Housing and Urban development would provide contracting licenses, and the education resources to receive one.

The following are the requirements for licensing and certification:

- Support the issuance of licenses to individual personal profiles based on successful education, and testing.

- Support the issuance of certificates to individual profiles based on successful education, and testing.

- Each license would require :

  - Personal Profile
  - Educational Domain Name
  - Top level .gov Organization
  - Any meta-data around the certificate or license that would be used in the market place.

## Education Integration

- Each top level Civil agency will have educational directory for each certificate and/or license.

- When the education requirements have been completed, the education domain would send the certificate to the .gov domain where it would be added to the users personal profile.

- Education domains must have a secure connection with their top level agency to provide certificate and license approvals.

## Container Deployment

- All top level domains would manage a container registry where all containers would have be signed provided by the NIST.

- All top level domains would have to have a number of approved hosting providers approved by the NIST that would be able to pull containers and run them, and roll back containers in case of issues.

- All top level domains would be responsible for ensuring there are test environments where the market could test next releases.

## Domain Names

All agencies must get a domain setup by the top level agency via Homeland Security where their government certificate will be issued to their domain.

## Sibling Jurisdictions

Top level organizations can have sibling jurisdictions. For example, the FCC could have a top level organization.

## Cross Agency Analysis

- Each type of agency at each jurisdiction will have metrics associated with them that must be released so civic agency over site and citizens can review them for inefficiencies.

A civic agency over site report is provided to the agency once a year for citizens to help deal with inflationary measures from voting on agencies directly.

## FCC Zone Applications

The general administration would have to approve all applications added to the general administration district. For example, a City would provide a Taxi application to its constituents and ensure the DOT Taxi applications were available.

## License Protests and Public Events

General Administration would provide protest and public event licenses to individuals.

## Health

A board can vote off a board member at any time with a majority vote. This could be because of health reasons, or lack of participation.
