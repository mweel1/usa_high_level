# Social Security Personal Profile

The Social Security personal profile will serve as the foundation for a modern approach to issuing Social Security cards and other government documents, enabling seamless digital interaction between the government and its citizens and the market place.

The Social Security Administration will act as a central repository for essential personal data, managing core identity services—from birth certificates to death certificates and everything in between.

We will begin by digitizing Social Security cards, birth certificates, driver’s licenses, and payment cards, aligning with the current standards of digital wallets such as Google Pay and Apple Pay. As the technology gains traction and adoption by both the government and the market, additional documents will be integrated into the platform.

Legislation will be created around who can access what and under what circumstances.

## New Born

Hospitals will have access to create a personal profile for newborn babies by licensed hospital management systems to social security.

They must post provide the following:

- JSON birth certificate with the personal profile when it's created.
- Finger and foot prints

Social Security will return a social security number with S-XXX-XXX-XXXX

Parents will also have their newly created children added to their personal profile via a confirmation that hospital must witness.

If the parent does not have a phone, their pin must be entered to create the association.

## Existing Citizens - Live Scan Office

A directory of licensed live scan agents will be available for all citizens to go and create a personal profile in person. This will be provided by the operating system when users create their American Internet login.

They will be instructed to bring all government documentation with them including:

- Government-issued photo ID (e.g., driver’s license, passport).
- Birth certificate and/or Social Security card
- Payment Cards

Once the citizen meets with the live scan agent. The live scan agent will have access at the social security office to:

- Upload all documents to a newly created personal profile including ID's, certificates and cards.
- The live scan agent will take 3 profile pictures to ensure face recognition systems can be used properly.
- Finger prints will be stored and provided to all departments that require it, where the social security will be associated.

The office will also ensure all the organization around family members are set correctly based on the documentation provided, and will have access to do this.

Family's with an illegal parent. Must have children with a a birth certificate and be over the age of 5, where a birth certificate will be created and set to Human and Health Services.

If the live scan is suspicious of the documentation, the availability of out of pocket questions will be available to use as a validation tool.

A sworn affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury must be signed, and immediate deportation will result in any falsification of information.

Once the personal profile is setup, the licensed live scan agent will authorize with the following government agencies:

## Treasury

A connection to the treasury will be made to the personal profile where all payment cards will be displayed on screen (with masked out numbers).

The live scan agent will validate each card, where it will be added to the personal profile.

## E-Check

Verify all bank accounts that come from the treasury are valid.

An amount for each account will come up along with the bank name, where the live scan associate will have to see a bank login with the bank account and amount.

Once confirmed, a bank account card will be added to the personal profile.

## Logging In - First Time

Once the live scan agent has completed the personal profile setup. The citizen can go back to their operating system, enter their social security number, and login with their e-mail and password where the operating system is authorized with the personal profile.

## Logging In - Second Time

Once authorized with the personal profile the operating system can use to use finger print data, or camera data to login the user in future sessions.

## Storage

### Birth Certificate

A birth certificate will be stored in the personal profile, that can be validated at [Human and Health Services](/civil-agencies/us-human-and-health-services/) with the HHS ID.

### Payment Cards

Both credit cards and e-check cards will be stored in the personal profile.

The operating system can request a one-time transaction Id to process it at payment networks via the treasury.

The following processing networks will be available in the market place to receive one-time transaction Ids.

- MasterCard
- Visa
- Discover
- AmericanExpress
- Treasury-ECheck

Each card must manage its own processing network, this is a requirement because of the [transaction safety](/civil-agencies/us-fincen/transaction-safety/) implementing that must be tightly controlled.

### Tickets

The personal profile will accept tickets from any business that have a license to issue them.

These businesses must also accept the ticket's via an NITS approved ticket point.

Only NITS approved ticket points will be able to request the ticket from the personal profile based on the domain, and event Id.

The customer and the ticket point will use touch point to request the ticket via [touch stream](/civil-organizations/us-national-institute-of-standards-and-technology/touch-stream/).
