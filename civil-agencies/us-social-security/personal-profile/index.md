# Social Security Personal Profile

The Social Security personal profile will serve as the foundation for a modern approach to issuing Social Security cards and other government documents, enabling seamless digital interaction between the government and its citizens and the market place.

The Social Security Administration will act as a central repository for essential personal data, managing core identity services—from birth certificates to death certificates and everything in between.

We will begin by importing Social Security cards, birth certificates, driver’s licenses, and payment cards, aligning with the current standards of digital wallets such as Google Pay and Apple Pay. As the technology gains traction and adoption by both the government and the market, additional documents will be integrated into the platform.

Public legislation will be created around who can access what and under what circumstances in the market place.

Where civic agencies will enact laws based on what data they can receive from the social security profile.

## New Born

Hospitals will have access to create a personal profile for newborn babies by licensed hospital management systems to social security.

They must post provide the following:

- JSON birth certificate with the details of the baby.
- Finger and foot prints

Social Security will return a social security number with S-XXX-XXX-XXXX

Parents will also have their newly created children added to their personal profile via a confirmation that hospital must witness, where they will have access to the profile, and receive confirmations on behalf of their children.

If the parent does not have a phone with them during birth, their pin must be entered to create the association.

All parents must have a personal profile setup to schedule an appointment for child birth.

## Existing Citizens - Live Scan Office

A directory of licensed live scan agents will be available for all citizens to go and create a personal profile in person. This will be provided by the operating system when users create their [American Internet](/civil-agencies/us-home-land-security/USA-Internet/) login.

They will be instructed to bring all government documentation with them they have available including:

- Government-issued photo ID (e.g., driver’s license, passport).
- Birth certificate
- Children's birth certificates
- Payment cards

At least one government issued photo ID must be present and a birth certificate.

All government Ids can be provided to the market using the [NITS standards](/civil-agencies/us-national-institute-of-standards-and-technology/govt-id-application/).

Once the citizen meets with the live scan agent. The live scan agent will have access at the social security office personal profile system to:

- Upload all documents to a newly created personal profile including ID's, certificates and cards.
- The live scan agent will take 3 profile pictures to ensure face recognition systems can be used properly.
- Finger prints will be stored and provided to all departments that require it, where the social security number will be associated. These will also need to be compatible for thumb readers on operating systems.

### Family Members

A parent would link a child by bringing in the child's birth certificate.

A $500 payment would be provided by Social Security for each child that was added to the personal profile, along with monthly payments defined by Social Security laws. This would be required since tax advantages would be lost in leu of voting for civil agencies directly.

Monthly payments on an on-going basis would be a law in-acted by social security.

Social Security should consider laws to keep culture diversity in our country, and keep races in-line with each other.

### Illegal Parents

Family's with an illegal parent. Must have children with a a birth certificate and be over the age of 5, where a birth certificate will be created for the parent and sent to Human and Health Services. The country of origin must be provided.

### Suspicious Documentation

If the live scan is suspicious of the documentation, the availability of out of pocket questions will be available to use as a validation tool.

### Declaration under Penalty

A sworn affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury must be signed, and immediate deportation will result in any falsification of information.

## Document Uploads

A lot of government documents are in a lot of jurisdictions systems. The following government IDs would be uploaded federally during the process to ensure validation capabilities. All jurisdictions would be required to upload these documents to these top level jurisdictions moving forward into the future.

Driver License - Would be sent to the Department of Transportation
Birth Certificate - Would be sent to the Department of Human Health and Services
Social Security - Would be sent to Social Security, where the name would be verified.

## Document Setup

Once the personal profile is setup, the licensed live scan agent will authorize with the following government agencies and their resources.

### Treasury

A connection to the treasury will be made to the personal profile where all payment cards will be displayed on screen (with masked out numbers).

The live scan agent will validate each card, where it will be added to the personal profile.

### E-Check

Verify all bank accounts that come from the treasury are valid.

An amount for each account will come up with:

- The first digit of the balance
- The amount in cents of the balance
- Bank name
- Account name

Once confirmed, a bank account card will be added to the personal profile for processing transaction on the [treasury e-check system](/civil-agencies/us-treasury/e-check/) which will provide $0 cost transactions between citizens and a DOJ jury system to resolve conflicts.

## Logging In - First Time

Once the live scan agent has completed the personal profile setup. The citizen can go back to their operating system, enter their social security number, and login with their e-mail and password where the operating system is authorized with the personal profile.\

NITS standard will require all operating systems will need an:

- E-Visa login
- Personal Profile Social Security login.
- World Wide Internet

## Logging In - Second Time

Once authorized with the personal profile the operating system can use to use finger print data, or camera data to login the user in future sessions.

## Storage

### Birth Certificate

A birth certificate will be stored in the personal profile, that can be validated at [Human and Health Services](/civil-agencies/us-human-and-health-services/) with the HHS ID by 3rd party services if required.

### Payment Cards

Both credit cards and e-check cards will be stored in the personal profile.

The operating system can request a one-time transaction Id to process it at payment networks.

The following processing networks will be available in the market place to receive one-time transaction Ids.

- MasterCard
- Visa
- Discover
- AmericanExpress
- Treasury-ECheck

Each card must manage its own processing network, this is a requirement because of the [transaction safety](/civil-agencies/us-fincen/transaction-safety/) implementations that must be tightly controlled.

### Tickets

The personal profile will accept tickets from any business that has a license to issue them.

These businesses must also check ticket's at the door via an NITS approved ticket point services.

Only NITS approved ticket points will be able to request the ticket from the personal profile based on the domain, and event Id.

The customer and the ticket point will use touch point to request the ticket via [touch stream](/civil-organizations/us-national-institute-of-standards-and-technology/touch-stream/).
