# Overview

## Social Security Objectives

Social Security will have a platform that will enact and vote on laws around social security. It will also provide social security services at the federal level, and the local level via social security districts.

Our country offers a variety of public assistance programs, such as food stamps and social security payments, aimed at supporting individuals in need.

To enhance the effectiveness of these programs, I propose consolidating them into a single Social Security platform. This would allow for better data collection, providing a clearer understanding of the publicâ€™s needs, and ensuring that support is delivered more efficiently and equitably to those who require it most.

Social Security will also be tasked with managing people in danger of becoming homeless, or homeless individuals.

Social Security will also be responsible for a [personal profile](./personal-profile/) server for citizens to manage all their government documents.

## Legislation

Social security will have a legislative function. For example, a person can be locked up or forced into treatment for mental illness and/or drug and/or alcohol addiction unless they pose a danger to self or others.

It's clear this law should re-evaluated as people that cannot take care of themselves should be admitted to mental institutions.

This is the power of legislating at the functional or organization level. We know where to go to set and get laws, and the boards approving them are educated in their domains.

## Social Services

### Retirement Funding

A law will have to be passed if social security is managed at the federal, or district level.

#### Federal Level

Social Security payments will be defined by the board each year.

#### District Level

If payments were voted to be handled at the district level, social security districts will manage the social security payouts for their district. Citizens will be assigned to a social security district for payouts based on the city they were born in.

### Out of Money

Citizens would be able to apply for social security locally if they had no income before retirement due to age or job loss, injury or other causes.

Social security would provide enough funding for:

- Local shelter housing
- Food and groceries
- Storage costs
- Trade school (for 6 months)
- Medication

Social Security would ensure participants were either attending school, or looking for jobs for a period of time set by the district law.

If they failed to enter the workforce after a time set by the district board, they would be directed to a mental health institution where they would receive:

- Shelter
- Eat at the house kitchen
- Storage costs
- Transitional services (2nd try)

### Jail

License social security agents will be placed in jails, and provide the funding to their personal profile, and book rooms at transitional-housing-organizations provided in the American Internet domain registry.

If they do not choose transitional housing, they must have housing confirmed by the consoler.

### Requirements

In-order to receive social security benefits before retirement one must be looking or a job, or be in school for a period of time set by the district. Social security will request access for school registration, and the jobs that were applied for to enforce laws.

If citizens do not apply for jobs, or goto school they will be admitted to a social security run intuition where all services will be provided to them. With this, all mental institutions with a local social security presents will be acquired from the state.

## Federal Social Security Agent Licensing

Social security will provide licenses and education for:

### Public Social Security Officers

- Transitioning them to mental institutions based on federal and local laws.
- Use DOJ provided police applications to call the police.
- Provide funding for people in need.
- Create and manage social security profile for the social security system to document their interactions.
- Provide protection for Social Service agents based on a destressed individuals actions (bear spray permits, etc).

### On-Line Social Security Officers

- Help with people that have been reported online by a citizens.

### 5 Step programs

- License managers that operate 5 step programs (e.g. AAA)

### Federal Domain Zone Application for Public

A domain zone application will be managed at federal level to allow people to report people in need where social workers would deployed and handle them based on their licenses and local laws.

### District Domain Zone Application for Licensed Social Security Agents

Each district must develop their own domain zone application to manage people on the streets based on laws and regulations of their district.

### American Internet On-Line Reporting

Furthermore, links would be available on social networks to report people that need help. Their login session id would be provided, where social security could receive from the FCC the actual person logging in.
