# Overview

## Social Security Payments

Social Security will have a platform that will enact and vote on laws around social security. It will also provide social security services at the federal level, and the local level via social security districts.

Our country offers a variety of public assistance programs, such as food stamps and Social Security, aimed at supporting individuals in need.

To enhance the effectiveness of these programs, I propose consolidating them into a single Social Security platform. This would allow for better data collection, providing a clearer understanding of the publicâ€™s needs, and ensuring that support is delivered more efficiently and equitably to those who require it most.

Social Security will also be responsible for a personal profile server for citizens.

## Personal Profile

The social security office will manage the [personal profile](./personal-profile/). A personal profile is a citizens wallet where all government documents will be placed, and shared with the market place.

## Legislation

All legislation will be managed at the federal level, where down stream agencies can veto them and provide alternatives. For example, a person can be locked up or forced into treatment for mental illness and/or drug and/or alcohol addiction unless they pose a danger to self or others.

It's clear this law should re-evaluated as people that cannot take care of themselves should be admitted to transitional housing.

This is the power of legislating at the functional level. We know where to go to set laws, and the people approving are educated in their domain.

## Social Services

### Retirement

Social Security districts will manage the social security payouts from the 33-66% percentile of the district in the last 10 years.

The retirement age will be voted on federally. Each age up/down will have inflationary effect by % on costs that need to be provided to the public.

All retirement laws, must be approved by the federal board.

### Out of Money

People would be able to apply for social security if they had no income before retirement age, which would include enough for:

- Local shelter housing
- Food and groceries
- Storage costs
- Trade School (for 6 months)

Social Security would ensure they were looking for jobs. If they failed to after a year of time, and jobs were available you would be placed in a .social-housing-center where they would take care of you. This would include:

- Shelter
- Eat at the house kitchen
- Storage costs

### Social Security Administration Licensing

Social security will provide licenses to personal profiles after they received for education for:

- License people to help those in the streets that are in distress. This will include transitioning them to transitional housing, or calling the DOJ police. A DOJ social conflict license will also be needed to handle violent people where bear spray usage will be licensed.
- License people on-line that are in distress.
- License managers of transitional housing units.
- License managers for services like AAA.

### Domain Zone

A domain zone application will be managed at federal and local levels to allow people to report people in need where social workers would deployed and take them to .social-care-centers with licensed social workers.

### American Internet On-Line Reporting

Furthermore, links would be available on social networks to report people that need help. Their login session id would be provided, where social security could receive from the FCC the actual person logging in.
