# United States Internal Revenue Service

Since civil agencies will be voted on directly, and taxes will be removed, we cannot forget one of the powers of taxes, which is to incentivize the market.

Without taxes as a lever, we will need to find new democratic or market-driven methods to guide public outcomes and incentivize behaviors that benefit society as a whole.

# Additional Role

The IRS will be in charge of the tax system to add or or deduct from items based on the laws various civic organization have in place to regulate the market.

This would include:

- Social Security to issue a tax credit for dependents.
- FDA to tax products that are a public health hazard, and provide public outreach programs.

Any money the IRS collects, must be given back to the originating civil organizations where specific programs and revenue are bid out for processing.

# Tax Transition

The IRS will remain open, and taxes will be reduced locally and federally based on the jurisdiction and its current tax base as its moved to civil agencies. For example, if we opened a Social Security Civil Agency we would look at the total tax basis federally and locally and reduce accordingly.

The IRS will be responsible for managing this, until all agencies are transitioned.
