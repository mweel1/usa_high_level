# Personal Licensing Agency

Personal licenses are issued to a user’s profile once they meet the relevant requirements of the various licensing organizations. These licenses are stored in the personal licensing agency’s system.

The licensing agency maintains a directory of educational organizations that offer the necessary training and certification for various licenses. Upon completing the required coursework, a user receives the corresponding license in their personal profile. Some licenses must be periodically renewed according to specific rules.

Certain software applications require a valid license to grant access through a personal profile. For example, a bartender license might be needed to log in to systems that manage bartender services. The personal licensing agency maintains a list of software applications and their license requirements, which are implemented in the marketplace.

License verification is enforced through business permitting agency. Applications must not only check a user’s license in their profile but also confirm its validity with the personal licensing agency.

Each license type will have an organization responsible for issuing licenses, setting the rules and enforcing them based on current laws. API Keys will be available for these organizations as they are verified by the licensing agency organization to add, update and delete licenses.

Many new organizations can be developed via [grants](/grants/) to manage licenses.

- Press - A person of the press that would be providing press information.
