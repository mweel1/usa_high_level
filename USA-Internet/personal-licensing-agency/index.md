# Personal Licensing Agency

Personal licenses are issued to people based on the requirements of the various licensees available. Which might include certificates, degrees and other forms of requirements. These licenses are stored in the personal licensing agency’s system for verification and the personal profile.

[Licensed software applications]() require a valid license, certificates to grant access to the system via the personal profile certificates and/or licenses.

For example, a bartender license might be needed to log in to systems that manage bartender services. The personal licensing agency maintains a list of software applications and their license requirements, which are implemented in the marketplace.

License verification are checked and enforced through the FBI by walking around and testing log-ins of employees.

Applications must not only check a user’s license and/or certificate in their profile but also confirm its validity with the personal licensing agency via the ID.

One of the big issues with the world wide internet today is mis-information. On the United States internet there would be requirements for anyone with a large audience online. Where they would have to hold a license for:

- Journalism - A journalist who is licensed to provide journalism to the market place.
- Press - A person of the press that would be providing press information, and would have to deal with various guidelines including:

  - All information that is provided must be factual from credible sources via the domain system.

  - If you speak of a death, it must be linked to the death certificate stored at human and health services. All agencies must provide death certificates to human and health services.

  - You are not allowed to be affiliated with other sources any in regard, and the American DNS system will look for these relationships and file claims against license holders.

- Influencer - A person that is influencing a large part of the population with media.

Here are some of the requirements of these individuals:

- All media sites with high usage must only allow these individuals to login.
- All media sites must provide a standard webhook to receive license cancellations, and must do a batch check each night.
- Any of these accounts that share content of others would also have to have a large audience license.

The requirement for a large audience license would be defined by the licensing board.

# License Application

The public would have the ability to view license details, and report license infractions to the licensing agency by an ID.

## License Information

The ID can be requested from people by receiving their licensing ID and entering it at the agency which would allow the user to:

1. Persons Picture
2. First and Last Name

## License Infractions

People can report license infractions of people where a case is filed and reviewed by the licensing board for that specific license.
