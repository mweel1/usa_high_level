# Preface

The world wide internet has become an untrustworthy service for the citizens of the United States. These issues range from:

- Financial fraud
- Misinformation
- Election interference from foreign actors
- Unregulated age restrictions
- Fraudulent email addresses
- Non-revokable domains

Additionally, we rely on corporations like Google to protect users from content. The original intent of the internet was exploration, productivity and innovation. The vision of the United States internet is to restore this.

# United States Internet

The United States Internet will run on top of the world wide internet.

A new domain system will be developed which would require a country code when resolving DNS. For example usa:whitehouse.gov

If no country code is defined the world wide DNS system is used, otherwise the countries DNS system is used.

## Domain Protection

Safety of content will be paramount to the United States Internet where a [content moderation service](./content-moderation/) will be used to moderate content based on national security risks.

## DNS Requirements

- The DNS will track all requests made for the directory service.
- All DNS logs will be sent to the National Security Agency where jurisdictions can request log information.
- No caching of DNS records is allowed on clients.
- No IP addresses can be entered into operating system to navigate to websites unless they are on local networks.
- All IP Addresses that are added to the DNS must be physically present in the United States and not route through any country.
- Domain names can be idle for 20 days or they must be returned the naming system. The naming system will be on a first come first serve basis.
- Domain names can have an optional API standard that is defined by ISO.
- Domain names
- When registering certain domain names and valid license is required.
- All DNS requests must provide a personal profile URL of logged in user, and/or business URL.

## Web Application Requirements

- Must provide an interface that interacts with the API.
- Must provide a customer facing API.
- Must integrate with govt API's where applicable.
- Must provide oAuth Services for integration into 3rd party applications to use the API.
- Anyone selling products must provide a supplier list by domain where a distance is calculated based on records.
- Must always check content for safety using the [content moderation service](./content-moderation/), a list of domains hit counts, and content protection agency queries will be available to determine that all content providers are using the service.
- All .gov websites must provide a communication API that can be picked up by social networks, where a link back to the .gov website must be provided.

## Security

Anyone issuing business permits will have access to manage their domain zones for businesses.

## Directory

The directory log of the United States Domain System will be available publicly, the recommended search engine would be in a domain zone.

## Domain Zones

All domains that are registered on the United States Internet DNS system can be registered to an [FCC domain zone](./domain-zone/). Application Zones gives domains context in which they are used. Some example of how application zones might be used are :

- You goto a concert and press the application zone on your phone and can purchase the concert.
- You go into a city and press the application zone and get a map of the city, trolly locations, taxi services and much more.
- You go on-line and select your housing community and select a used product marketplace site that allows the community to buy and sell products from each other.

The goal of application zones is to bridge the gap between the physical world and virtual world with more context lies.

All domains that are registered on the United States Domain System will default to a federal application zone with the FCC as consumer facing if no domain zone is registered.

## Operating System Licensing

Validation of all operating system releases, browsers, and e-mails clients are required to ensure that all services meet applicable laws and regulations during the [OS and application certification process](/os-certificiation-process/).

## Domain Claims Court

The Domain Claims Court is a jury based system where complaints are processed and managed.

For example, the domains claims court would the authority to do the following:

- Warn domain owners.
- Fine domain owners.
- Shut down domains.
- Revoke a government ID holder's ability to operate domains in the future on the United States internet.

The domain court would find jury selections using the Jury services/[/jury-services].

The domain claims court can be activated by citizens if the site:

- Violates terms of service
- Violates cancellation policy
- Display media content without an media content Id, media server and media categories & filters.

## Crawling Websites

- All content will be crawled using the [content moderation service](./content-moderation/) that is on the rise.
- All content will verify the age restrictions of the website with the DNS system.
- All content will be moderated for national security

## Starting Up

When first logging into the United States Internet, the user would be required to setup a [personal profile](/grants/personal-profile/).

If the user could not provide a United Stated government issued ID along with verification they would be considered a foreign user where they would have to apply for an [express-visa](/express-visa/) using a passport. Once approved they would have a [personal profile](/grants/personal-profile/) setup on the United States Internet.

### E-Visa Violations

If users break laws or violates any other laws of the United States Internet there express visa could be revoked for a period of time, or indefinitely.

## Market Availability API

Each operating system would have an application zone section on the phone. This would be initiated by pressing a domain zone button on the device.

The United States Internet would provide the following to the market place via an open API.

- Domain logs
- The native applications, domains in the zone based on the GPS.
- The business address and license of any domain.
- Open jury cases, and closed cases of the business.
- Business license and address information history.
- Cancellation Link
- Terms of Service
- Privacy Policy
- List of review sites chosen from the .domain-review domains.

## Operating System Requirements

Operating systems that operate on the USA Internet must provide the following during DNS resolution:

- Ensure a [personal profile](/grants/personal-profile/) is setup for the country in which they are connected to before navigating to any domain.
- Enforce age requirements using [gov.id authorization](/government-os-services/id-gov/) when access domains that requires age verification.
- Each domain type will have a terms of service template that must be met at least once, or when changed.
- Link to cancellation policies for the domain stored at the DNS server.
- Link to file complaints in domain claims court to resolve dispute with domain owners.
- Provide domain claims court case resolutions that have occurred in the past.
- Provide a list of review sites chosen by the domain owner (at least 3) from the site review directory.
- Show a special icon when displaying government communications from the personal profile.
- Must provide their device type when making DNS requests to receive the correct application IDs to launch applications.

## System to System Standards

The main goals of the United States Internet would be to ensure that open [system to system standards](/grants/system-to-system-standards/) are created to allow:

- business to business (b2b)
- business to consumer (b2c)
- government to consumer (g2c)
- government to business (g2b)
- government to government (g2g)

To begin to develop these standards we will start with the following use case:

1. Allow the city to search businesses, and get directions to them.
2. Allow an artist to post their music on .artist domain name and submit content to the moderation service and media server.
3. Allow the artist to publish their music for discovery to various networks that they choose to allow preview of content.
4. Allow a restaurant to purchase their music from the artist via a network.
5. Allow users to press the application zone button and purchase music from a live artists that is playing, or provide a tip.
6. Order food from a local restaurant where its delivered via food delivery services.
7. Order food at the restaurant
8. Purchase tickets to a show
9. We will then get into supply chain solutions.
10. All public/govt data is an API so it can be shared with upstream data points.

### Special Requirements for domains

.school must publish all its stats around job placement and income anonymously.

### Business Requirements

Each business or government agency will have an organization directory with a personal profile URL.

Each employee can be assigned to the storage account(s) of the business with their personal profile URL.

Anytime something needs to be saved, a business URL and personal Profile URL can be provided from the operating system.

Business URLâ€™s can be assigned in an operating system as part of the permissions along with a personal profile when setting up.

Anytime a file is prepared to save on a storage account (business or personal) its confirmed from the personal profile via the socket connection to the profile.

### Transportation

All local transportation will have a .transportation domain name. They will set a rate for their service per mile, terms along with what cargo they can transport.

All business could add these as trading partners in their business with a deal in place.

The delivery services will provide invoices when they do deliveries to business where they will be paid.

All deliveries must provide a QR code for complaints to the business.

### Special Domain Requirements

All .donation domains will have to:

- Provide a list of donation fund names.
- Provide a social feed of what they do with the money, by fund name.
- Provide the amount of money they have received by fund name.
- Must have a .fundraiser license to run .donation domain names.
