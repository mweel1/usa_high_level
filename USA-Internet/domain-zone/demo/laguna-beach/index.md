All these services would be backed by consumer to business API's and business to business API's. For example the shopping application would know how to view inventory, place orders, and schedule delivery for all retail stores in town making shopping simple and easy for citizens and visitors alike.

For example, your should press the shopping application and then search by product, or store. On shoplaguna.com. Once your cart was complete, you would place the order with the store with the url profile your website, and all websites that will be processing a transaction of the user and the card token. The application would use OS services with URLS. The user would then get a request for payment from all the stores with their logo, url which has to match up with the source of the original payment url.

The purchase window that is installed on operating systems would pop up if the urls were the same as the original transaction request. A card would be selected with a one time use card token would be sent to the store where they would process the payment in the gateway(s).

Sending payment requests to people without them initiating, or receiving funds without selling a product and service will go to either Visa Court, or Electronic Check Court.

I suggest Visa create an open system to handle charge backs that the public can see, or start a credit card company that would at least.
