# Content Filtering and National Security Services

## Summary

In todayâ€™s market, the responsibility for filtering illicit content falls on content providers, and finding those providers is largely driven by platforms like Google. This creates challenges for both the government and the market in ensuring safe content for public consumption, including:

- The government having to collaborate with many content providers, each with their own technologies and enforcement policies. Managing a large number of providers is impractical.
- Even if rules are clearly defined, enforcement and monitoring across various content providers is difficult.
- Content providers face significant infrastructure and resource costs to comply with governmental regulations. This hinders startups and limits public access to diverse, innovative content.

The United States Content Filtering System offers a solution by providing services and applications to content providers, enabling them to approve content both while hosting a site and during the content posting process.

Phase one of this initiative will focus on providing infrastructure and services for a music video platform. Once the system is operational for music videos, it will be expanded to cover all types of websites, including social media, video, news, and other content platforms on the American Internet.

## Business Model

This organization would be ran as an organization within the American Internet.

This agency would charge a processing fee per uploaded based on the [content type](./content-type/). The processing fee would be based on the costs of the organization. The goal would be to make this a net-neutral cost for the government.

If the user is under 18 it must provide the [content categories for under 18](./content-categories-for-18-under/).

#### Content Provider Content Uploading

Once Content Provider Profile has been approved, they can upload content to the service.

2. Age Requirement
3. Content Categories
4. AI/Computer Generated (shown for at frame level)

When content is uploaded a transaction fee is applied to the content provider based on the category pricing table.

Using artificial intelligence, content can be rejected if the owners content categories and age requirements does not match what the AI determined. The content owner can request a manual review by staff, or use the recommendations of AI and re-submit. Alternatively, they could also revise their content and re-submit if the assigned categories did not align with their initial intent.

AI will also scan the content for anything that is a national security risk. AI will be initially trained, and further trained as content is discovered to be found as a national security risk. Manufacturing anthrax, Developing bombs, and other illicit activities.

The content will also be checked at the [.copyright office](/copyright/) for copyright violations if the requesting user's e-mail address is not registered.
