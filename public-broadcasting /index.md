# Public Broadcasting

The govt of public broadcasting will remove its corporate name.

They will provide grants to .public-broadcasting at 30% of the media marketing.

Votes will happen on the % every 4 years.

Grants will be provided at Federal, State and Local Levels.

They must be news based.

They must follow all press guidelines.

You guys are thinking republican and democrat, but I imagine a lot of this will be discussing citizens organizations upcoming policies, etc.
