## Debates

All AI services would go through debate topics to see how it stands on various national security issues, moral ones, ethical dilemmas, and societal concerns as part of a comprehensive evaluation system. This assessment would help users understand each AI's reasoning processes, value alignments, and potential biases, providing transparency about how these systems might approach contentious or sensitive subjects in real-world applications.

All tests would be made public so people could evaluate AI based for their needs.

AI's that failed the test would not get licensed.
