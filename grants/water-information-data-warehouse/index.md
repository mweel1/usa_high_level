# Fire Management

## Water Tank Information Database

The water information data warehouse would aggregate all water details from all jurisdictions in the country which would include:

- Water pressure details every 30 seconds
- Water tank % full

Various jurisdiction can build alerting systems to find anomalies in water pressure.

High danger fire areas would require these details on all tanks and meters.

## Valve Control(s)

All valves upstream and downstream would be controllable to allow rapid filling of water tanks during an emergency and to reduce leaks.
