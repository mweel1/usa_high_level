# Medical Testing

In order to bring down medical costs we must start providing services on a cash basis. One of these areas for opportunities is medical scanning equipment.

A grant will be provided for the education of licensed professionals to provide tests. Business loans will be provided at a low cost to manufacturers of testing equipment and business loans.

Medical testing operations in a country can vary widely depending on the healthcare system, regulations, and available technologies. Below is a categorized list of medical testing operations typically conducted in most countries:

1. Diagnostic Tests
   • Blood Tests: CBC, lipid profiles, liver function tests (LFT), kidney function tests (KFT), blood glucose levels, etc.
   • Urine Tests: Urinalysis, urine culture, pregnancy tests.
   • Imaging Tests: X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, ultrasounds, mammograms.
   • Genetic Testing: For hereditary conditions, chromosomal disorders.
   • Pathology Tests: Biopsies for cancer or other tissue abnormalities.

2. Infectious Disease Testing
   • Viral Infections: COVID-19 tests (PCR, antigen, antibody), HIV tests, hepatitis tests.
   • Bacterial Infections: Tuberculosis (TB) tests, strep throat tests, urine cultures for UTIs.
   • Parasitic Infections: Malaria tests, stool tests for parasites.

3. Routine Screening Tests
   • Cancer Screenings: Pap smears, colonoscopies, PSA tests for prostate cancer.
   • Metabolic Screenings: Cholesterol tests, thyroid function tests, diabetes screening.
   • Developmental Screenings: Newborn metabolic screening.

4. Specialized Testing
   • Cardiac Tests: Electrocardiogram (ECG), stress tests, echocardiograms.
   • Neurological Tests: EEG (electroencephalogram), nerve conduction studies.
   • Allergy Tests: Skin prick tests, serum IgE testing.

5. Preoperative and Postoperative Testing
   • Blood typing and crossmatching.
   • Coagulation studies (PT/INR, aPTT).
   • Basic metabolic panel and chest X-rays.

6. Occupational and Public Health Testing
   • Drug and alcohol screening.
   • Occupational health screenings (e.g., respiratory function tests for miners).
   • Vaccination-related immunity tests (e.g., titers for measles, mumps, and rubella).

7. Reproductive and Fertility Testing
   • Hormone tests (e.g., estrogen, testosterone, FSH, LH).
   • Sperm analysis.
   • Ultrasounds for ovulation tracking.

8. Environmental and Toxicological Testing
   • Heavy metal screening (lead, mercury, arsenic).
   • Testing for toxins or exposure to hazardous substances.

9. Preventive Health Checkups
   • Annual physical exams with routine lab work.
   • Wellness panels for early detection of conditions.

10. Point-of-Care and At-Home Testing
    • Glucose monitors for diabetics.
    • Home pregnancy tests.
    • Rapid tests for COVID-19, flu, or strep throat.
