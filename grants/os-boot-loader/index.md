# FCC Boot Loader

The FCC will provide a boot loader for all OS systems that will include authentication mechanism, and a directory to install operating systems for that device using Linux.

The user would turn on a device. The device would take a picture and create a fingerprint of the picture.

The device would then ask for the personal profile. The device would send the fingerprint to the personal profile. The personal profile if matched would ask the user on a separate device if its safe to login.

If the user did not have another device they would enter their pin.
