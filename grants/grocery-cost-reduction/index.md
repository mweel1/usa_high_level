# Grocery Cost Reduction

Grocery costs and other inflationary segments of the market could be reduced by:

- Allowing different transport companies that transport segments the ability to register on a site.
- Using the American Debit system transfer money to the system.
- Provide a debit gas card to allow them to purchase gas.
- Set dynamic gas prices based on how you would like the market to shift.
