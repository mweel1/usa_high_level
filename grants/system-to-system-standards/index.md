# System to System standards

## Transportation Businesses

All transportation business must provide the incidents that occurred.

## Business to Business

We will develop API for all businesses to business interactions that can be implemented by business providers.

These will be organized in networks, for example:

- An artist entity that could upload content and set pricing and offer it in various markets for sale.
- A hotel business would allow users to read a magazine about music, purchase tickets, purchase music that would be ultimately delivered to their [personal profile](/grants/personal-profile/).
- A registered Movie Theater entity could purchase movies from producer entities for viewership and movie theaters.
- A general tik tok style product might be open sourced where various businesses could build their own markets with content providers. For example the UFC could have a tik-tok style app, or a news company could use it to pay for news segments.

Many standard based networks would be created, especially for the [micro-industrial](/grants/micro-industrial-revolution/).

# Product Safety

The ability to bring up networks and sell products and services easily will create a risk for illicit products. We will ensure this by making sure all businesses have a valid business license and only sell UPC cataloged products.

It will be the job of local authorities to ensure the products and services sold are the ones approved in their business licenses.

# Business to Consumer

Many business to consumer standards would be created to make for a more efficient process between business and citizens [personal profile](/grants/personal-profile/).
