# Fire Detection Satellite

It is feasible to find flare ups using satellite communications.

In the case of the satellite system finding a flare up, it will notify the correct authorities via the [dispatch system](/federal-emergency-dispatch/)

White lists can be created where fire is a normal occurrence.
