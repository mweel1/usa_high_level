# Television Operating System Grant

## Overview

A television operating system grant would provide funding to develop a TV operating system based on the fundamentals of the United States Internet.

## Technology

This television operating system would use the United States DNS system and find all websites that are providing API services for TV based content.

This content would be searchable within an interface based on the [content filtering and security services](/content-filtering-and-security-service/), where a user could preview the content and pay a small fee where their content would be saved in a local library.

Futhermore, a chart system would be provided to allow people to see what content is trending based on the category filters that have been set.

Content owners would be responsible for their own content streaming from the consumers, and would have to have scalable hosting as part of their licensing provisions. The television operating system would cache previews of the content when new content came on-line.

All reviews would use the directory services for review services licensed to review media content.
