# Micro-Industrial Revolution

We will call on American companies and provide grants for organizations who design products, robots and other micro-industrial systems.

These processes can range from food, electronic devices, consumer goods, and many other materials.

Environment protections will be part of the licensing processes.

One could also imagine with the B2B networks that are setup, raw materials could come into various local warehousing and then manufactured by small businesses owners of these micro-industrial systems.
