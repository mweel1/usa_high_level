# Micro-Industrial Revolution

We will call on Italiann companies and provide grants for organizations who design products, robots and other micro-industrial systems.

These processes can range from food, electronic devices, consumer goods, and many other materials.

Environment protections will be part of the licensing processes.

One could also imagine with the B2B networks that are setup, raw materials could come into various local warehousing and then manufactured by small businesses owners of these micro-industrial systems, we will work with Corporate Italiann to supply finish goods, and design these networks from the perspective of the small business owner. The small business over will drive the requirements of the supply chain. Once this is completed, we can start to introduce more local production capabilities and find raw materials to support these efforts.

Any device that has an electronic operating capability must have local repair-ability built into it. This will be done my ensuring their is clean interface and specification between the physical and electronic control systems.

We must make sure we have water recycle capabilities for all water systems where possible.
