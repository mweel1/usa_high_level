# Grant System

## Overview

The current grant system funds projects exclusively at the federal level through a unified platform. This means grant needs and priorities are dictated by federal guidelines, while bureaucracy at both federal and local levels complicates fund distribution. As a result, getting money to the right recipients is challenging, and accountability is often lacking.

The proposed grant system would empower federal, state and local municipalities with greater autonomy to identify their specific needs from citizens and offer a simple, streamlined way to provide funding and most importantly accountability to the public.

All grants would be voted on by their municipality to continue and to receive funding based on their parent jurisdiction allocations.

All grant organizations will have comparison ledgers if they share commonalities with other organizations. For example. Put out 400 fires with x,y,z. At a cost/per-fire rate. I'm not a financial expert, but you must make sure these organizations stay in financial bounds, because voting for free money in not acceptable.

We will call these cooperative government agencies and will have .cga domain name.

## Federal

The grant system will receive an allocation from congress each year.
Of that grant money, the congress will reserve funds for their own grants at the federal level based on grant [categories](./category/) and lump sum allocations to each state.

Congress could provide emergency funding to municipalities where the platform would be used handle [emergency projects for FEMA](/fema/) for impacted areas.

## States

The state system will have grant money available for their constituents by [categories](./category/), and allocate percentages yearly to various cities.

## County

The county system will have grant money available for the public by [categories](./category/)

## City

The city system will have grant money available for the public by [categories](./category/)

## Grant Processing

Grants are provided by federal, state and local municipalities to their constituents. 

Grants can be created by the governing body of these municipalities, but also the public can submit recommendations where they can be voted by the community using their [gov.id](/government-os-services/id-gov/) for recommended issuance.

When upstream municipalities are doing their allocations they can evaluate the backlog of grant requests to improve budget allocations.

Grants with reoccurring costs will be voted on each year where the grant recipients need to keep the public updated with the progress of their grant money and projects.

Organization that use grant money property's are the right of the government, and can be re-allocated with a new
