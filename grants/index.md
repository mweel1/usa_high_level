# Grant System

## Overview

The current grant system provides funding exclusively at the federal level, meaning grant needs and priorities are determined solely by federal guidelines.

The proposed grant system would empower federal, state and local municipalities with greater autonomy to identify their specific needs and offer a simple, streamlined way to provide funding and most importantly accountability to the public.

All grants would be voted on by their municipality to continue and to receive funding based on their parent jurisdiction allocations.

All grant organizations will have comparison ledgers if they share commonalities with other organizations. For example. Put out 400 fires with x,y,z. At a cost/per-fire rate. I'm not a financial expert, but you must make sure these organizations stay in financial bounds, because voting for free money in
not acceptable.

I would like to ponder the question, if people are voting for these organizations to serve the public, they are indeed government organizations. That conflicts with our tax base and their organizations.

One might consider winding government offices down and start pulling off taxes and transition government agencies to organizations that are monitored and funded directly by the public.

If we started self funding and closing government organizations citzens would have to be aware of inflation or deflation repercussions as best possible.

## Federal

The grant system will receive an allocation from congress each year.
Of that grant money, the congress will reserve funds for their own grants at the federal level based on grant [categories](./category/) and lump sum allocations to each state.

Congress could provide emergency funding to municipalities where the platform would be used handle [emergency projects for FEMA](/fema/) for impacted areas.

## States

The state system will have grant money available for their constituents by [categories](./category/), and allocate percentages yearly to various cities.

State citzens can

## County

The county system will have grant money available for the public by [categories](./category/)

## City

The city system will have grant money available for the public by [categories](./category/)

## Grant Processing

Grants are provided by federal, state and local municipalities to their constituents.

Grants can be created by the governing body of these municipalities, but also the public can submit recommendations where they can be voted by the community using their [gov.id](/government-os-services/id-gov/) for recommended issuance.

When upstream municipalities are doing their allocations they can evaluate the backlog of grant requests to improve budget allocations.

Grants with reoccurring costs will be voted on each year where the grant recipients need to keep the public updated with the progress of their grant money and projects.

Organization that use grant money property's are the right of the government, and can be re-allocated.

As grants can take a roll of government offices users could set if they would have their own tax basis or not. This could make a difference easier or harder for the government due inflationary and deflationary free money could provide.

Here are a few grants I would propose on this system:

- [Personal Profile](./personal-profile/). A place to store all the information about you, much like a wallet but it would be portable on all OS devices, and available to applications.

- Lost & Found. A federal grant for a lost and found system.

- [taxi.org](./taxi-org/) an organization that provides locations for people that need a ride and licensed drivers on the American Internet who wants to give them.

- pet.org an application to manage pet populations.

- weather.org a data store for all weather data.

- air-quality.org data store for all air quality data.

- [home automation grant](./home-automation/) grant will create standards to let devices in homes communicate with home automation services on the Internet.

- [adoption.org](./adoption) would manage the entire process adopting babies.

- [micro-industrial revolution](./micro-industrial-revolution/)

I suggest all grant money comes from the military as we move to more local processes our need for oversea adventures will be diminished.

I would also like to see the United State's export this technology to give us a good standing in the world again.
