## Ownership Tracking

## Birth Certificate Registration

When an animal is born, the breeder would log-in and register the breed where a chip would be sent to the owner where a licensed chip injection specialist on the [/United States-internet](/United States-internet/) would insert the chip. They would be the owner of the breed at the time.

## Transfer of ownership

At any-time the owner can transfer the chip to another owner where they would become the owner via e-mail address if they were allowed to purchase animals. You must fit the following qualifications to transfer the animal to an owner based on its type:

- Nobody in the household can have criminal records of animal abuse.
- Must living a residence large enough for the animal.

## Finding Lost Animals

A dedicated place would be used for chip injection for the animals that public would be aware of via [public service announcements](/public-service-announcements/)

If an animal was lost where the pet agency application would loaded from the [Public RFID](/public-rfid-specification) where the pet agency application would load with the contact information of the owner. A secure text message channel would be setup between the owner and the person who found the dog where they can coordinate.

## Verification of Ownership

Registered .gov agencies can have access to the pet agency application that would allow them to scan a tag and send a text message to the owner where they would verify with a verbal code.
