# Animal Population Management

Animal population management would ensure there is not over population in markets and to approve breeders when they want to breed animals.

## License Breeders

License breeders would be allowed to login to the animal agency where they would request to breed animals. This would include the parents, and the estimated count.

## Request to Bread

Based on inventory of the breed and sales trends in the area the breeder would get an approval for breeding.

Depending on the technology available DNA could be sampled by the parents where any issues of breeding could be brought up and denied.

## Sales

A commission between the breeder and the sales channel would be setup.

An API would be available to for all breeders that would let them sell the animals in the market place. An application for each breeder could also be developed if they choose.

Before a customer could own an animal they must go through the [licensing agency](/licensing-agency/) based on the type of animal they are purchasing and get certified.
