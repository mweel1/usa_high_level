# Survey Services

Ensures trusts in the market for non-transferable assets that would allow customers to do some action in the marketplace and receive an ID where that service would provide a seal when viewing that ID along with the action that took place in the market place.

The ID will be provided the personal profile whenever these services issue the ID.

# Surveys

Surveys will create two ID's for the market. One is the survey ID of the survey, and the other is a participant ID for each participant that participated in the survey.

In social media when every giving survey results the survey ID must be provided where it can be verified on the verification area of the site.

Once this is completed we will do a service for awards and non-licensable certificates.
