# Home Automation

There will be thread based hub that connect to devices via the Thread protocol.

This thread base hub will connect to a home automation application service on the internet via OAuth where a web-socket would be available to trigger devices commands and receive events. These services will be found in the domain directory as .home-automation and available on wi-fi routers.

The thread base hub could be put into bind mode, where when a device button would be pressed it would be shown, confirmed and then the user asked to press x number of time to bind it to the device.
