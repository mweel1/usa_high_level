# Home Automation

There will be thread based hub that connect to devices via the Thread protocol (ZigBee based on not IP based).

This thread base hub will connect to a home automation application service on the internet via OAuth where a web-socket would be available to trigger devices commands and receive events. These services will be found in the domain directory as .home-automation and available on wi-fi routers.

The thread base hub app that is bounded with the wi-fi base hub could be put into bind mode, where when a device button would be pressed the number of times shown on the screen, confirmed and then the user asked to press x number of time to bind it to the device.

The TV box has a thread enabled device that turns it on and off, and has menu controls.

Any speakers that are connected to the TV thread device will also have volume controls.

If you want to play music, your TV will be connected to your personal music collection and subscription.
