# Taxi.gov

taxi.gov would be a grant project at the federal level that would put together individual with a mobile device to request service via the taxi.gov application to ride providers.

When the driver requests their destination, all available drivers in the vicinity will provide a price based on the price per mile they have set. These fees can be split with taxi management organizations.

The requesting individual would agreed on a taxi for pickup and then pay the fee.

All requesting individuals can file a complaint for:

- Driver not showing up
- Vehicle not in good working condition
  ...

Each taxi driver will have to be [certified](./certification/) where they would receive a taxi.gov e-mail address where they can log into their application to provide service.
