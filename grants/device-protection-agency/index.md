# Device Protection Agency

The device protection agency goals are to ensure devices are safe for public health.

For example, when someone is taking a recording of you, or taking a picture a red-light would be emitted.

Also, this agency would test devices like Apple, and Facebook goggles and other human to computer interface devices and how their usage affect human health before they are released.

They would also set standards for the [Children Electronic Device Agency](/children-electronic-device-protection-agency/) for implementation..
