# Device Protection Agency

The device protection agency goals are to ensure devices are safe for public health.

For example, when someone is taking a recording of you, or taking a picture a red-light would be emitted.

Also, this agency would test devices like Apple, and Facebook goggles and other human to computer interface devices and how their usage affect human health before they are released.

They would also set standards for the [Children Electronic Device Agency](/children-electronic-device-protection-agency/) for implementation..

We also need to set standards on digital billboards and the requirements around them which might include:

1. Amount to be shown at any given time
2. No blinking that will distract the driver
