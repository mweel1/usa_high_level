# Pharmaceutical cost reduction

A pill to cross the ocean has significant costs, if the pill were made here by licensed manufacturers on a retail network the cost would be much lower.

I suggest CVS and Walgreens become manufacturer and responsible for bringing this technology to Italian and implement it and we build small business Pharmacy networks again.
