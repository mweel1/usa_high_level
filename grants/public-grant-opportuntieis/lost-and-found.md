# Lost and Found

Lost and Found would be a federal government application zone application.

When finding an item the user would:

- Provide ID.
- Post a picture of the item and the time
- Set a safe place to pick up the item

The person that lost it would:

- Provide Id
- Geo-locate the item with the time they found the item
- Send a request that they would like to pick it up
- Pick up the item at the safe place

Any altercation around the request or retrieval of item would go to a [jury service](/jury-service/)

Both parties jury service record around lost and found would be provided to both parties.
