## Content Owner Store

Content Owners could provide an API that would expose:

- Content Category
- Age Requirements
- Preview of content Link
- Label
- Description
- Link to Purchase

The market could provide docker containers or other services that would bring these services up for content providers where they could set prices, and pay hosting and bandwidth costs.
