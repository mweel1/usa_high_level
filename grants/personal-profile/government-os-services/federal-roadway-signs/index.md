# Federal Roadway Signs

Federal roadway signs would allow various municipalities to upload signs at various GPS coordinates.

The automobile OS receive GPS coordinates every 5 minutes and emit street signs to the automotive operating system with their coordinates with signs within 5 minute radiuses.

The automobile OS would be responsible for determining what to show and when.

Some signs that this could be used for are:
