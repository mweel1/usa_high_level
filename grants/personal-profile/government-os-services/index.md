# Preface

The government services would be a set of services that would have to be authenticated when a user sets-up their personal profile. Once these services are authenticated they would provide keys to use the services at various interaction points in the operating system.

Operating system would include mobile phones, personal computers, vehicle systems, and any future devices users might work with.

Allowing companies like Apple and Google to provide government services is problematic for a number reasons:

- The government has to work with many operating systems to deal with their technologies and policies for enforcement. How many do you want to work in this scenario?
- Rules although might be clearly defined, are hard to enforce and monitor with operating system providers in the market.
- There is large infrastructure and resource costs for operating system providers to implement these requirements. Especially for new market participants.

# Overview

- E-Check [echeck.gov](/e-check/)

- Emergency Communication System [ecs.gov](/ecs-gov). To receive emergency communications from government agencies.

- National Security Agency [nsa.gov](/national-security-agency). To allow the government to access your phone with a warrant.

- FEMA Emergency Response Keys [fema.gov](/fema/)
  To allow the government to update keys on your phone to access emergency services.

- [Citizen to Local Dispatch Communication](/local-dispatch/). Allow the citizens to send dispatch requests to local dispatch for police and emergency services.

- [Census Participation](/e-census/). To register for census services via e-mail.

- [Jury Service](/jury-service/). This would register for jury services, where the operating system would provide notifications and reminders of needed jury service needs.

- [FBI](./fbi). This would allow the FBI to use your location if you were near an active investigation and would be need to be contacted for questioning.

- [FCC Application Zone](/application-zones). This would setup a channel to receive application zone details when users were in certain areas and pressed the application zone option on their operating system.

- FCC Emergency Communication System [ecs.gov](/ecs-gov). To receive emergency communications from government agencies.

- [Local Dispatch](./local-dispatch/) is a communication channel that allow operating systems to communicate with local dispatch systems.

Operating Systems with shared datastores may use these authorizations (for example ICloud, etc)

For vehicle OS's the following services would have to be authorized:

[Federal Roadway Signs](/federal-roadway-signs).

[Children Device Protection](/children-electronic-device-protection-agency/) service keys to manage the use of devices for guardians.

Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) service keys to manage the update of all medical records and receipt information.

U.S. Department of Labor services to view your resume events and view resume events to help better understand the job market. This will not be correlated with your identity.

Once these services were authorized and the keys stored in the [Personal Profile](/grants/personal-profile/) operating systems would have access to them.

# Security

When authorizing with these services an access key will be received for each government during personal profile provisioning. Each time the operating system boots up it will receive new access tokens from the personal profile to access government services.
