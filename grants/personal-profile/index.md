# Social Security Personal Profile

The social security personal profile will be the beginning of looking at a new way to issue social security cards and connect with the citizens in the internet age.

The social security office will have a hosting infrastructure that will provide a list of providers that will server the personal information of citizens from birth certificates, to death certificates and everything in-between.

We will start with just the social security card, drivers licenses, and payment cards and move to other government documents that are sent to citizens as the market adopts the technology.

## How it Works

### Personal Profile

When a user logs into an operating system for the first time, they will enter their social security number.

If they currently have a personal profile already setup the operating system will connect to it to have the contact information, government ID, and payment cards of the logged in use.

If they don't have a profile, the citizen:

- Uploads their government identification and verify out of pocket questions
- Take pictures of their payment cards where they are added to a payment wallet
- Authorize with the social security office to register the profile.

Once completed they are logged into their operating system where the operating system can use the citizens data.

### Business Profile

Users can connect to business profiles of businesses by selecting them from their business license of the business they work at.

All business licenses must have their Tax Identification Number where they are grouped if multiple businesses are present.

### Foreign Citizens

Foreign citizens must go through a process similar to citizens, but through the visa office instead of the social security office. The process involves:

Scanning their passport to create a personal profile
Authenticating with the visa office using OAuth
