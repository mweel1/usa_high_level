# Social Security Reinforcement Act

The social security reinforcement act will be the beginning of looking at a new way to issue social security cards and connect with the citizens in the internet age.

The social security office will have a hosting infrastructure that will host all citizens own personal information that the government provides them from birth certificates, to death certificates and everything between.

We will start with just the social security card and move to other government documents that are sent to citizens as the market adopts the technology.

## How it Works

When a user logs into an operating system for the first time, they will enter their social security number.

If they currently have a personal profile already setup the operating system will connect to it to have the contact information of the logged in user from the social security office.

If they don't. They upload their government identification and verify questions, this personal profile is then connected to the Social Security Office.
