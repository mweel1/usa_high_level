## Communication

When setting up your wallet you will select a communication provider, within this communication provider you can setup a number of lines where communication provider id and line number is setup in your personal profile.

You can provide these public communication provider Ids to anyone to make a call via QR Code, [Touch BlueTooth](/touch-bluetooth/) or e-mail. All OSs must accept the communication provider id header to add these Ids to the a personal profile.

All communication providers must bridge calls to standard phone and messaging systems.

## Making a call

When making a call to any line, you can set to be private or public.

The destination communication provider is connected where it will ring for voice calls, and send a notification for text messages.

There must be support for group communications also, where a multi-plex provider must be connected to the personal profile.

## Receiving calls

When receiving a communication, if the call is public your avatar, personal profile URL, name will be provided.

The profile URL will allow the receiving caller to request information.

## National Security Agency

AI, or agents will connect to both communication providers, and multi-plex providers to listen for communications that would be a security risk.

With a warrant other jurisdictions can request communications with a list of provider ids and line ids along with a date range.
