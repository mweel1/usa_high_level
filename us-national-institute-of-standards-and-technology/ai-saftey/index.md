# AI Domain Registration

Any AI domains that are registered must be approved through the NTIS where:

- AI questions are passed to the AI, the AI from previous models are compared with the answers to new ones, and AI is used to find security risks.

- Many debates are run against the model, and compares to previous models to see if any security risks have been introduced. AI and people will be used to monitor this.

- Each AI service must pass through an AI filtering system at Homeland Security (AIFS) to find security risks, where the destination domain is attached to the filtering service and a keys are provided to a client for routing.

- The AIFS system will handshake with the domain to ensure its authenticity.
