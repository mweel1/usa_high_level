# Hud

## Overview

Hud's goal would be to provide the data necessary to get United States's income inline with the affordability of housing to the federal reserve.

Whenever a house is purchased or rented the information will be sent to the personal profile and then to HUD.

Today the federal reserve tries to solve these issues with a fixed rate across the board which creates imbalances in sectors.

This information would be directed to the federal reserve and their banking system that support the housing market place.
