# Bike OS

A directory of licensed applications would be available for your bike-os that could be installed on all e-bikes.

OS's would have services in the web container to bind bike devices that would manage the attributes for a bike (turn signals, breaks lights, etc.) that the application an interface into.

You would need a license of .bike-operator to download and install the software on a the bike and operate it.

There must be an interface from all devices on a bike with the bike itself using serial RPC.

A fee would be charged to ensure all safety when getting approved.
