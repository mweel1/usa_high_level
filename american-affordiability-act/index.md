# American Affordability Data Warehouse

## Overview

The American affordability act goal would be to provide the data necessary to get American's income inline with the affordability of housing.

This would include data from the IRS and mortgage services and would show where there are in-balances occurring in the county.

The following action can be derived from this data at county levels.

1. Prevent investments in homes that are not occupants.
2. County based variable lending rates as a governor for supply and demand.
3. Variable rate construction loans

Today the federal reserve tries to solve these issues with a fixed rate across the board which creates imbalances in sectors.

This information would be directed to the federal reserve and their banking system that support the housing market place.
